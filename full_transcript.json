{"text":"Speaker 22: Okay, actions. Speaker 16: So I think most of the key actions can actually be close. Sachi provided a written update to everybody yesterday. Speaker 11: So as part of APT cleanup, we did go through all the SCs who have custom contracts. We identified errors. The errors have been corrected. But to your question, last time, we are looking at it is a combination of refunds we have to make to the merchants as well as clawbacks that we have to do. Both of them net out to about 583K. We're going to be working with Sarah Steam merchant by merchant to really look at the contract and see how far back we can go in terms of both the activities and align on the action steps. So that's where we are. The second thing is as a result of this, a full process assessment was done. I talked about it in the last board meeting. Various sets of controls have been put in place between CLM organization and acquisition organization, pricing, as well as servicing organization. All of them will go into effect on January 2026. Kurinda, that needs to be 2026, due January 2026. And the first testing will happen in March for all of those controls. So we're on track. This should be all create by January. Let's say 2026. Yeah, that's well. Speaker 6: So in terms of those new controls, you're comfortable that they should be sufficient to kind of make things more robust going forward in my life. 11: Yeah, that's the word, make things more robust. But a lot of those controls are still manual, like a second pair of eyes looking at it, so you could still have issues and errors. But there's a periodicity that's coming in in terms of regular review with the CLM organization as well. I think if there are errors, we've catched them. And now, if there are earlier we didn't have controls, now we have the controls. We just have to continue to test those on the tricky box. Speaker 5: Can I just ask a question, Joe, about the 1.1? I think previously we discussed about having fraud data, but it looks like that's been closed. Any more light you can shut on that one? 22: So as part of some changes that I'm making to compliance reporting up to various governance committees, I'm trying to cut down the quantity of material that the boards are seeing. So this will come to the risk committee for views. But I think reporting generic data up to the board is pretty necessary, but we will report things that are flashing red by exception up to the boards just to make sure that we're not being overwhelmed with data here. Speaker 12: And then there'd be a threshold that we probably escalate chapter one, I would think. 22: Yeah. We have a threshold that we should have. Okay, good. Right, let's keep going. 6: Sorry, one other thing on this page. The bottom one, 1.6. We're saying that the actions were resolved with all committees providing detail directly for me. He still hasn't sent anything on those health funds. I don't know, Keith, if you've seen anything more on that. Speaker 4: I'll happily chase him. Which one was that? 6: Sorry? So this question came up, it was two or three board meetings ago saying that we should have the visibility to the funds that we were withholding from merchants, which I kind of thought Paul would have readily available, but it doesn't seem like it's something that he necessarily does have the visibility to. Speaker 15: I think he took an action to provide it to you, but he's obviously not followed through, so I can actually close that. Is that on the action list? 6: Yeah, it's the bottom row, 1.6. 22: Well because at the time of the records being taken, Paul said no problem I'll provide it so I just need to make sure he follows through. Okay fine. Can you make sure that happens then? Yeah. Otherwise we shouldn't really close that action. Sure. Okay anything else Gorinda on the actions? 16: No there was just one other one which is proposed version 3.2 but I understand Joe you're going to cover that as part of the verbal update. This is about why the company has a high number of clips in Hungary. Yeah I know but yeah. We'll cover that in the verbal update and then 4.2 we're going to ask Greg for an update on that one in the KYC update. 22: Okay can you've got a note to do that? Yeah I have perfect. Okay good. Let's go into poor competition. So got that slide up. So vector today Louise has been removed as chief compliance officer and removed as money laundering officer and the proposal which was always the plan really is that Joe will take over the role of chief compliance officer and the MLRO officer as well as the DPO and everything else. More hats than you could imagine. So Joe's CV is in the pack. I'm sure you've read Joe's CV and many of you have got to know Joe over the last couple of months since he joined the company in the summer I think it was wasn't it Joe? Just the 7th of July July. 7th of July there you are. Lucky day for some. So I don't suppose Joe would take over that role. 16: Subject to the subject. 22: Correct. 16: So role roles, plural, subject to the data which we get the FCA. 22: I think it's probably worth noting that I am conflicted on that point. In what way? I can't really advise from a colonised point of view. Not wearing the two hats. Yeah. I think there's a question in the pack about is it the right thing to have an individual wearing all those hats? 15: What do you mean in terms of I thought there was a question in the pack that I read about having one person with multiple roles? Or did I dream that up? Let's see that. Speaker 8: Is that a dream that came? 22: So when you say multiple roles, you mean the multiple people? I think both the MLRA and CEO, I mean, it is what it is. Okay, yeah. They tend to come together as a group. It's all the kind of second line, non-risk. I mean, that's the way we've run for years. Yeah, there's no conflict there when you're referring to conflict. Oh, no, sorry, no, the conflict I was referring to was I can't, I'm conflicted in commenting on the appointment. You can't comment on his own appointment. I'm sure he's got a view on his own. Do I? So good. Subject to FCA approved. Good. Done. Very good. Welcome, Joe. To your new responsibilities, subject to FCA approved. Okay, right. It's me. So, what am I going to tell you about Episode today? So, DVV perspective, these numbers are. These numbers are from a week or two ago. We've seen a really good end to November, we were planning to be about 13% ahead year over year. We've actually, the latest numbers are 16-17% year-over-year for the Black Friday week. So, we did not see a reduction in spend as a result of budget. In fact, we saw a massive increase in spending there's no timing issue around Black Friday or Psych Monday. So, we've seen a really, really, really good end to November. I mean, probably even better than anyone could have ever hoped for. TE on the bottom left still looks weak. Actually, when you take out Payfax and the fact lots of Payfact, lots of restaurants have moved to Payfax, which is showing up on goods and services. TE would actually be about 10% growth for November, and goods and services is about 1% less if you took the restaurants out. So you can see how much the there's obviously less TE volume than there is goods and services volume, but you can see how sensitive the TE volume has been to the PayFax, taking the restaurants. And it's simply a reporting issue that the restaurants are showing up as goods and services under the PayFax. That actually, when it's normalised, is roughly about 10% on the left-hand side on TNE, we've seen in November, and on the right-hand side would be about each number would be roughly about 1% less. So we are actually much more balanced than we think we are across TNE and goods and services. There is work going on to sort this reporting issue out. I'm not sure it's going to come anytime soon. It just means we are effectively under-reporting our TE volumes. 6: Is there anything that's going to be done on that sort of thing you head to the year-end reporting at the enterprise level? 22: I don't know. I asked Justin yesterday, it's immensely complicated to work this through. The challenge is, I suppose, where you've got markets that have got more PayFax volume, you're losing your management information around segments and what's growing in segments. When you look at restaurants in the UK, it looks like restaurants are declining 9% as a segment, they're not. But I think you've also got lots of businesses moving to ISVs as well, which is showing up under goods and services and payfax. So at some point, we will have to sort this out if we want to have it. If we want to have the same MIS as we've historically had, Julia, by segment industry. GMS KPIs on the next page. Good year for GMS. We actually went through, I'm not sure whether EAPSOR did, but from a GMS business perspective, went through the 100s. billion barrier a couple of days ago so that's that's locked in it was um right last week of November massive milestone for the business DBVs come in just behind plan 12% up year over year purely driven this slightly weaker inbounds we saw at the probably the first two three quarters of the year inbound was slightly weaker than we thought it would be there's a there's a little there's been local was a little bit less but it's really driven by less inbounds revenues have come in 7.1% up year over year 3% down versus plan that's two reasons the first reasons revenues are down is because we've seen much more growth in PayFax which is a lower rate so we've seen a margin impact we've also seen much more growth in lower discount rate nurturing so Pizza Express USL versus Fine Dining as an example the third reason is SECM share so there has been a lot more spend with PayFax and where there's more spend with POFAX GMS keeps less in some cases takes none gets no discount revenue all goes to the issuer and that mix of how much was going to take place with Payfax is well out of sync in terms of the plan Julia compared to what's actually happened it's actually about half of our revenue miss is SECM and it was SECA is a result of SECM versus plan you can think of it like that but that's all stated obviously within the blue box and then PTI has come in 2.0 nearly 360 million 2.6 down versus plan 11.6 up year over year really been driven by cost reductions so obviously the revenues flows down to PTI the gain in PTI versus revenues has really been driven by OPEX management and you know keeping Rolls open, less investment in marketing. Discount rates, Satchi, do you want to talk about that or I could talk about that? 11: Go ahead. 22: So, rates 3.23 bips down year over year. I think I'm right in saying Satchi 2 bips was in the plan, or 2.14 was in the plan. One bip, the extra bip, is driven by what I talked about in terms of nicks and rate and people spending in lower discount rate industries. 11: What is that 10 plus 2 then? So, the comparative windows, so 10 plus 2 forecasts. So, normally everything else you compare it with 1 plus 11, right? 22: 2 plus 10 in this case. 11: Yeah, this is the October forecast. So, October, 10 months of actuals, 2 months of forecast, compared with 3 plus 9. 22: So, where we think we're going to end the year is 3.2 bit. 11: You're talking about footnote, right? 22: Yes. 11: That's just the comparative time periods. 22: Yeah, the parent point period is slightly different. This is end-of-year metrics. It's where we think we're going to end the year, 10 plus 2. Okay. 11: So, 210 is versus. So, the top three metrics are compared with 210, which is two months of actuals and 10 months of forecast. But, discount rate has been compared with 3.9 because we don't forecast 210. We only do it in January and then in 210 is the plan. Speaker 9: Yeah, no, I was just wondering why it's so far. What you said, the plan was two, and we ended up 3.2b. 8: I was wondering why we're so wildly different than the one on the left. Speaker 10: But I guess that's not that. That's what I'm saying. 11: No, I think your question is different then. So, one, we forecast it only in three lines, and even from 3.9, there's a big difference. And the big difference is primarily coming from account mix, which is essentially what has happened is, as Dan said, three sets of activities happen: one is pay fax have come in, the second is some of the larger merchants which got renegotiated. The likes of Spotify, etc., we give a much better discounted and they're growing much, much faster than what was in the finance plans of Paulo Forecast. So bulk of it is pretty much driven by account mix in terms of the erosion. 22: I mean the other way you could think about it is you've got customers spending more in you know good you know people say this is a bad thing but you know it's not necessarily a bad thing you know people spend go and spend at home bargains they go and spend at ms you know they spend at audien little and tesco there's you know people are using the newer card members the newer vintages of co-op members are using their cards for lots more transactions than people we acquired 20 years ago and they are you know we get nearly eighty percent of their credit card spent and they're spending in lots more of our merchants and we're growing pti and revenue here yeah we're growing revenue so like the net the dis the average discount rate has been impacted and just for context for everybody typically two to three bips is average year on year erosion you see a lot of it is actually driven by gcg deals which are very heavy on impact at least for half of it is gcg so the way you think about it is a third is secm share a third is sorry a third is a third is um a third is um growth in merchants pay for a third is gcg and a third is local account mix yeah and so i don't think it's a bad thing and next year we expect an even greater erosion because we have some very expensive gcg deals coming through headquartered in u Samazon and Google which will have a big impact we have so those have been so the right hand side is the percentage year on year so like this year we have like two three point two three next year we have about four bips anticipated for UK how much is Amazon uh is the bip under I mean that's the company's strategy, right? The company's strategy is to maintain rate in the US and give rate in international because obviously there's much more volume in the US. So when you negotiate with Amazon like they've done, there's a big give to Amazon International. 12: We also have a premium in the UK. It's actually the premium in the US you have. 22: You give more in international that Amazon can have what they want and then you maintain in the US where you've got more volume. 12: Where they don't have a premium at all. 22: They have a small premium. 12: Yeah. 22: Okay. Any more questions? I've never known so many questions on the financial slide, so you're all awake this morning, more awake than I am. Okay, next page is the coverage results. So this is where we this is these are this is actually the rolling rolling 12 numbers. You can see each of our metrics that we track, so each of the geographies, so London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Manchester, where we are year over year in those geographies for active accepting locations and then where we are versus planned. So we probably already have got more than 1.8 million active accepted locations. That's where we plan to end the year just shy of 2% ahead of plan, 15% up year over year from a coverage KPIs perspective. So all geographies growing nicely. The next page is just a recap for you, just to bring everything together. The Lyft coverage survey top left, I mean there's a lot of noise around this because on paper it looks like it went backwards. They've re-looked at some of the matching and it now looks like it didn't go backwards at all. You actually are at 81% coverage but they're not restating the results. It's all to do with how they're matching with PayFact data. So evidently they are finding a location like a sandwich shop in Victoria Station and then they are having to look that up in the global sponsored merchant file and their ability to look it up in the global sponsored merchant file is not as good. Their ability to look it up as if it was a proprietary location. So, when they've redone some dribble, some areas, they found we actually have three percentage, we're at one percentage point gain overall. So, if you projected that across, that's where we'd end up. I've kind of moved on from it, like I can't waste any more time on we've grown locations as you saw on the previous page, but 15%, you know, two percent ahead of plan, 1.8 million active locations. Like, there's more coverage, you know, if the survey says there's not, fine. Um, active accepting locations, you can see on the bottom left, that's where we want to end the year, 1.8 million active accepted locations. The good news is our co-op members are telling us 85% of the time they can use an Amex card where a Visa card is accepted, so that went up one percentage point year over year. So, that's good news, that's what our customers are telling us. Uh, and then some of the top merchants our customers asked us to sign are just below there. And then, just to finish up, uh, MPS, you can see the results there, they were they were they've come out since the last board. Good trend on MPS, you can see the growth across segments. So, UK was up six overall, field up, CLM are four for that's field, ten for phone, and thirteen for small. So, good results across the uh across the business. Um, just in the interest, yes, sorry, in the interest of time, um, quick question on the previous two slides, yeah, and this is a picky one, yeah. Um, on slide 034, uh, we've got active accepting locations up 13% year on year to 1.8 year to date. Um, on the previous slide, we've got 15%. Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a, because it's, it's, um, it's a number, if you look at it, it's um October is effectively the page 35 is effectively a measure to the end of October. The data for page 30. I think is the is the actually it's not year today, it's probably the full year position, and it's been the numbers have been rounded, Joe, so they've just been rounded up. Obviously, we've taken 1.78 and 1.6 is where we ended 2024. We didn't end 2024 1.6, we ended it at 1.58 something. So I just think it's in the rounding of the numbers. 12: Just to say, it looks like someone's trying to join. 22: Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Business updates. You're going to hear, I'll quickly spin through this. You're going to hear a lot about KYC and where we are. That's been a huge focus of business enablement. We had our consumer duty sessions last week. We had the customer forum. There's a lot of work been going on with Satchin, Team Off Fair Value. We'll talk a little bit about that as well as off Res. Partnerships with Keith. Keith's going to talk about PayPal data and oversight when he gives his update. There's an audit going on at the moment with IAG on PayFax. Acquisition. I suppose the key things to call out are Wine Sartre, which was the biggest e-comm holdout, is now live. Some key other signings, entertainment big yellow. There's discussions going on, as there always are with lots of merchants. And Pay with Bank Transfer recently won an RFP for EDF. It says decision imminently damage RFP was won, which is huge for the Pay Bank business. And then from a renegotiations perspective, you can see the wins on the slide there. DVLA is now, I'd say, verbally agreed. So that's not happening. And we feel very good about the DVLA. Is that fair? 12: DVLA and a Viva. 22: The Viva's on the slide as resolved. 12: Yeah, yeah. 22: Okay. Alright, so good, really good progress by the team in a final push in the last month of the year to get lots of stuff done. I just want to finish up by talking about priorities for 2026 very quickly. So we are orientating everyone towards growth efficiency and governance aligned with the market priorities for the UK. The mission of the nurtured business for the UK is to grow the network profitably and compliantly in places that matter to achieve 1.1 billion of PTI as a market and 85% plus coverage. The key thing I've called out there is we talked previously about 90% coverage. It feels like 85% is more where people want us to aim from a coverage perspective. There's also no time, you all know, cater to that. Whereas previously we said the end of 2027. I think there's a recognition. That's interesting. Sorry? 8: That's interesting. 22: I think there's a recognition that, like, you know, I think there's a belief, Satchi, that to get to 90%, you need to sell the kitchen sink and the carpet and the towers on the wall and the tabs. I don't think that's true. But I mean, we have a plan to exceed, well exceed 85%, and we will execute that plan. There you are. In terms of how we're going to do that, growth. 6: There's obviously different metrics that we look at from this perspective. 22: This is the Lyft net. This is the Lyft coverage survey. So we're at 81, effectively, with the data corrected today. And we have a plan. Well, 81 is the data corrected number. 10: So last we saw 78, right? 22: Yeah, but we just remember when I presented the page because they do, because of matching. 3%. It's huge. It's a huge difference. So we have a plan. The night plan will deliver Satchi probably an additional 3, maybe 4%. And your plan probably delivers 2%, maybe 3% if we execute against that. So we have a plan to well exceed our target concept. Which is good news. From a growth perspective, Accelerate key prospect, focus on profitability. We want to maximise our nine partnerships now. So we've got PayFax launched. It's all about maximising them, making sure we get all the merchants we possibly can. We want client management if they have the time to spend looking at gaps. We want to scale, continue to scale pay for transfer. And we also want to grow Amex offers and also look at whether there's opportunities to charge fee-based revenue. So things like business insights, can we charge for that? Blue dollars, green dollars, could we charge for setups to effectively grow profitability for the business? Efficiency, deepen partnerships within client management. We don't want to lose anything, obviously. I want to use a lot more AI in the business. It's a tool that's been rolled out recently for nearly all the frontline teams in the GMS world. And it's, you know, personally, I've been using it a lot and it's driving massive gains in my efficiency and productivity. And then finally, from a regular look, we want to get everyone to embrace it. If we can get 10% gain across everyone, that would be a huge gain in efficiency within the business. Governance, finally, we need to meet our local regulatory requirements, focus on good outcome, business conduct, dial up pay factors oversight. And we want to continue with our push to have zero aged issues and events within our strength and control environment. We're all together by winning as a team. So that's the mission for next year. We're working on another page which I'll present in February at the board meeting, which is effectively a set of metric deliverables again that sits alongside this page that lays out how would we measure whether we're delivering against those priorities. So I'll share that at the board in February and then as I've done previously do a mid-year update about how we delivered against those priorities. Any questions? All made sense. Everyone clear what they need to do? Mission? Clear. Crystal clear. Very good. Let's move into risk committee, Keith. Brilliant. Okay, I think we've got Suzanne just joined us. 4: Welcome, Suzanne. If we skip down, we're going to concentrate on the exact summary as always. So, Suzanne will kick us off on the first three points, then I'll pick up the remainder. So, over to you, Suzanne. Speaker 14: Thank you. So, the first thing we wanted to share today is that the Risk Committee, the Secretariat, we are updating the methodology that we are using to assess the risks to the entity. Really, this is in line with a lot of the enterprise changes that are happening. We need to be in harmony with that. So, we've taken into account changes that have occurred with AMP 90, which is the new risk taxonomy. That has also impacted AMP 47, which is the policy for operational risks. So, we want to make sure that we're in line with that using the correct terminology. Also, making sure that as things have been introduced, for example, a critical risk is now within AMP 90. We need to make sure that we're also assessing things up to critical, whereas previously we only assessed to high. So, lots of work done there to make sure that we've done it accurately. We've introduced a scoring model as well. So, previously, we had very, I would say, defined lists of what triggered high, what triggered medium, what triggered low. But now, bringing in a scoring methodology as well, that means that there should be no subjectivity, we should be assessing everything to the same level, so we've increased the rigour there. And one of the other things we've changed and introduced is making sure that we consider the breadth of AMP 47, the operational risk, and that again. Again, it is sort of in line with the way the RCSAs are working. So, for example, previously we may have assessed something as a regulatory risk and just considered it in that one element. Going forward, we may also say, Well, it's regulatory, it could maybe therefore also have legal impacts, it could have reputational impacts, for example. So, rather than just assessing against one pillar, we will be assessing against multiple pillars to make sure that we really have got the right impact of that risk at the end of the day to assess with the entity. Obviously, a big activity, and we want to make sure it's been done correctly. So, we backtested to the existing RIC. You know, we would expect to see things are going across four elements: critical to low rather than high to low. But we also want to make sure, for example, that nothing stupid came out as we were doing this and that we hadn't got any of the scoring or anything wrong. Pleased to say the back testing went well. We identified one element that would have been critical. The item is closed now, but you may remember the VPN outage we had last October where the partners couldn't submit and staff couldn't log on, for example. That would have triggered the critical, and it feels right that that would have triggered critical. Prior to taking it to the committee, we did run everything through ERM and through Joe Usher, rather than Joe or my team, just to make sure that we've got their input. We've got ongoing feedback, but we will continue to enhance and involve, but we kind of got the tick in the box that it was the right thing to be doing right now. So, that's our methodology uplift. I'll just pause if there's any questions. 4: I just add quite a lot of change going on then from a risk management perspective, of course, organisationally, and for the risk committee, it means we're managing this change and then also tracking risk differently with events, with issues. Remediations and our aspiration is as some of that nuts and bolts gets done from a system perspective that by the time we meet, I think the next board is everywhere, we'll have a refreshed view of those remediations, issues, and events as well. 15: But that's very much work in progress depending on how the system presents the data. How much extra work is that then for everyone? Do we have the right resources in place to do all that work? 4: Well, I think the tracking sits really predominantly with Suzanne and with Jo from her team in terms of trying to pull the data. It's definitely more challenging right now, Suzanne, right? 15: But we're engaging the central teams who are driving this change to get a point of arrival when we know will be a steady state. Is there anything you add, Suzanne? 14: I was going to say it's probably good maybe to flip to item number three, which ties into this. So I think everyone's probably aware that old OREs have disappeared. They were all closed on the 20th of October. We now, as Keith just said, we have issues, we have remediations, we have root causes, we have new REs. At the moment, there is only reporting for issues, and even that reporting is not particularly reliable. As Keith said, we've engaged the central teams, but it does mean that as we actually reassess everything on the RIC to our new methodology, we actually have to completely rebuild the RIC. So that's our risk register, the risks, issues, and changes that we review. So, you know, previously you'd have seen the slides from us where we look at the aged OREs, for example, and we show the times and everything like that. We can't do any of that at the moment. The data and the reporting doesn't exist. 22: When will it exist then? Suzanne, sorry to cut across you. When will it exist? 14: We are being told it will be resolved by the end of the year. It's not within our control, that's part of. Problem at the moment. I think, as you're probably all aware, Archer has become New Archer, that's its name, and the reporting elements of New Archer haven't been robust. Some of the things, for example, we noticed on the issues reporting is that the previous EPSOL branches, you know, the pre-Brexit ones like Germany, Sweden, they were being associated back to EPSOL and not to IPAY. That's a change that we've been able to get resolved. So that was fixed on the 17th of November. But we're waiting for the more generic reporting. What we've been able to do at the moment is manually map everything that we had on the old RIC that had an EV number. We've been able to map that to the new either issues or OREs. So we've got a clear audit trail between what did exist and where they sit now within the new issue management process. We are struggling more to pick up new OREs, which now have an ORE number, not an EV number, because the reporting isn't there. And I think we also need to understand what data is going to be presented in Archer. So I'm sure Anuke's taken some of you through this, but an ORE will no longer last for up to 320 days. An ORE is going to last for 45 days. And not all OREs are going to be deemed material. So actually, something that's deemed non-material, there will be no activity on ARCHA for that event. Archer will only be tracking the material events. So we're going to need to see what information is there and how we are therefore able to track going forward. So a lot of change in that space. As Keith said, we're really hoping we will be able to have something robust for the next risk committee and thus the next board. But we also Need everything to happen centrally for us to be able to do that. We'll continue to do everything we can in the interim, but it is manual activity at the moment. 22: Okay, I think that's fine for the moment. Obviously, if it was still an issue in next year, then we need to bring that back because it's imperative we have correct porting for the risk and power your risks of the business, right? 6: Yeah, these are actually raised up through Lead Up as a concern, the lack of reporting. You know, both the lack of reporting currently and then also the fact that this new archer system had gone in without engaging the local entities first. That's right, Susie. 4: So, should we do the same? I mean, personally, I'd be inclined to see. Well, we're engaged with the central teams at the moment, and I think they're being helpful, Suzanne. Keep me honest. If by early year we don't have a good level of confidence that by the next board we can share what risks we've got on the table, then but I think the issue is why did the change happen? 22: I think to this point is why did the change happen without any because effectively the way we manage risk within the business was changed for us without us knowing about it. 15: Yeah, I don't did anyone come and speak to you about changing well the whole risk methodology has evolved into as well as we talked about as Suzanne described earlier, but I mean that's an enterprise approach to tracking risk within the business rather than a but changing the tools and not an upgrade. 22: I mean can you give the example something like Orbit? Look at the diligence we went and the time we spent through to make sure we had managed the change and had minimum you know negative consequences from changing our platforms to orbit whereas this change occurred and no one's even consulted on you about it. 8: I think the concern that these board was most worried about was that this gap in information real-time status information and basically 22: There's like a it appears there's going to be a I'm sure it will get fixed but it appears there's going to be a hiatus between which we can see where we're at and when we will again be able to see where we're at in the meantime what sort of operates in the dark Karen was saying that they've got ways and means and they're doing their best it's all manual the same situation for us you know we we've got ways and means but all the while it's manual but Susie we were the only thing is we like that changed no one made no one in this room I think was involved or consulted that there would be a period where we might be in the dark no no so that that means a process wasn't followed from this we discussed that under the sort of leg up yeah structure you would have expected that to have come down yeah from wherever the decision was taken yes or advice slash consultation with the small city with the local legal entities or at least the ability to ask questions and get the assurance as to what we would do at the interim seems like you're all kind of presented with this situation that you're managing as best you can but it's not ideal so I think that that aspect of it that's the leg up was the leg up who was actually Karen and Hannah couldn't action that okay so do you want to take an action for me Keith and Suzanne to do the same action to do similar I mean the I think issue yeah I think from a legal entity point of view it's helpful to if something's been kind of imposed on us without discussion even if easel is already doing it we're doing it from this side from this board as well okay and I'll speak to because I would expect IPA to want to do the same okay they've had their disputes go but they haven't done that okay all right 14: I think when we had the IPO board being step up, the challenge wasn't as clear. 16: Okay. Somebody say Italy. There's maybe another bigger point. Yeah, thank you. 4: Okay. Should we skip back to item two then, Suzanne? 14: Yes, and just actually as the conversation's gone on, there's also been a new AMP 83. That's not, I think, going to drive this kind of system change, but it's also going to be something we're going to need to react to. It's looking at risk statements for legal entities. I think to an extent we're partway there because we have the entity risk self-assessment, but I think there is going to be some work we'll need to do to bring us to that standard. So that will be something I think in the next board we'll be discussing more, probably more as an FYI at the moment than anything else. Speaker 19: Okay. 14: So the number two item, the third party autonomic practice risk assessment, we were updated at the risk committee and the risk committee that the board should be aware. There was a supervisory letter issued. We have to be careful what we can note and can't note because the Fed would not want that we can share things internally but we can't share anything externally. But a supervisory letter issued around the third party processes and that obviously impacts IPO quite significantly given the breadth of the letter would cover sorry quite significantly the breadth of the letter would cover MR, MRPS and PAFAC which is the IPO arrival model. The sort of number of the letter is it clearly considered there to be gaps in the diligence and Rigour we have around our oversight of the third parties, and they are issued sort of two main findings: one around transaction monitoring rules, not so significant for EAPSOL, but then one around the actual sort of rigour and due diligence we have over the partners. The sort of long-term results of this will obviously increase the robustness of the due diligence and also increase the consequences that are expected if elements are missed. We're going to be looking at better due diligence questionnaires when partners are onboarded and at refresh level. Enhanced monitoring of the partners with more robust KRIs, dashboards, and again consequences. There's going to be a requirement for PAFACs to report on financial crimes and sanction matches to it and dynamics, which currently they don't. And then one of the other elements is around data remediation. So today a lot of challenge comes in when partners send incorrect data, missing data, maybe 999s instead of detail. And today there's really not a lot of consequence around that. That's going to be uplifted with better controls at onboarding to make sure that the data is meeting our standards initially. And then today we also have exceptions around data gaps, and those exceptions are going to be narrowed down and removed so that everything we receive is what we would expect to receive. So a lot of work in that space. So the plan is long term, goes through to 2027, but we'll continue to monitor that to ensure that it's progressing and that ultimately comes through. It's good for EAPSOL. 22: Any questions? 11: Just that a lot of owners will be on the partners then, right? 15: More owners, yeah. And then the policing of that, enforcement of that. Which is where Ox Rax are healthy. 10: You know, one of the things we opted here is AMEX asks are more ownerous. They are more ownerous. But this is a supervisory letter, this is not AMEX asking you. 22: There's been a supervisory letter about more due diligence on third parties. It hasn't said you need to collect this piece of information from this partner, this piece from this partner. 11: But I guess with the fact that you have a supervisory letter means now partners won't care. 22: They'll turn around and say, that's the US, that's nothing to do with us. I don't know, that's my view. Yeah, the biggest challenge would always be that we're the acquirer. American Express. 15: So you're not really comparing apples with apples when they talk about the information they need to collect for the other schemes because in those instances they are the acquirers and they already have the information. 22: But we do ask for more. We need to be realistic. We were going through yesterday, Joe, with your team, a case with the PayPal which I was managing because it looked like we were going to have to cancel PayPal on Thursday for the UK as part of one of a high-risk refresh project. We're asking for more, but we're always asking for more because our stance is slightly more cautious. Speaker 1: Yeah, but then that's why it doesn't work, right? We need to do their homework before asking the merchants, right? Maybe we have a two-tier approach, but we have one approach for smaller merchants where to your point we ask for more. But for large merchants, I can tell you we are losing a ton of credibility. Because if you think of the PayPal example that happens in a lot of countries with a lot of global merchants, it just doesn't work. 22: But that's the policy running. That's the issue we've got to put our policy as a company, our policies, our procedures, what we ask for, regardless of whether you're a small merchant, medium merchant, or a big merchant, we ask for more than if you were acquired by World Pay or Visa MasterCard. And that's just the way we were our risk emulator. And Joe, maybe you can comment more on this. Aren't we slightly more cautious? We're more concise. 1: We ask for information we don't need then, which was the case that we uncovered with Petal yesterday and it happens a lot. We ask the merchants for information. They say, hold on, why do you need the personal address of the directors or things like that? Even the legal reason why you need it. Then we dig further deep and we realize we don't need it. So why did we ask it in the first place? In the first place, sorry. 10%. 22: It's because it was a mass approach. These are the fringe cases where there is friction. But Veronique's correct. You know, when you sit and managing global clients, lots of them, there's a lot of, and it's same for you, Sarah, and there's a lot of friction that comes up. Speaker 3: The only other way to do it would be to be very bespoke for all of the major clients, like not put it into services. But that would cost us a huge amount of SMAC, the large ones. 12: Or an excertion basis. We're doing it through SAM team. 22: Yeah, but look how much that costs. 12: No, no, I know. But like. 22: It's not, we can't do that on an on-game basis. Okay, we'll digress, but I thought it was a good conversation. Anything else, Keith? 4: Yeah, so just the last few points with there's no slides provided, but number four, global payments, you will have read, there's a delay to the migration of their existing book, which includes MR and MRPS partners. Those MR and MRPS partners have some data gaps. So in the next board, we'll come back and present what the plan is because we had originally committed that those merchants would be immigrated by the end of Q1 or early 2026, we said, which isn't going to be the case. So we'll come back the next board on that one. 22: I think there needs to be, we've discussed this, there needs to be a plan for migration. There needs to be a definitive either plan for migration or a plan for cancellation. We can't just let these things spin out and out and out when we've got data gaps. Because we're telling the regulator we're cleaning everything up, we haven't got any gaps anymore and we've got gaps. Yeah. 15: Yeah, I mean, cancellation is always there and it's always within our control, so we can determine that. So, more to discuss next time. 4: Just to again close out a point from the last board meeting, enterprise risk management have said. 22: Sorry, on four, can we just joke? Can we go get you to go through this if you're team and understand? Because I'm not sure you're as familiar with issue number four on this page. How material are those gaps? I think, can we take an action future? Because we had an assessment for compliance, but we can revisit it. When was that assessment? Six, nine months ago. How material are they in what we are in the discussions we've had and our planning to have with the FCA? We can take that as an action because that will determine the you know, can we keep lawn grass for another three months and or is this does this need solving? 15: Sure, we can pick that up. 4: Um, item number five: so we've had the first version of the enterprise risk management risk dashboard, which was shared at last board, and there's no issues for raising to the board, but no escalations there. Just a question for the board: does the board want to see that report even where there's no escalations, or is the board satisfied that we will escalate where any more thresholds have been triggered? 22: I think it's fine to escalate where thresholds are triggered. Good, okay. What do other people think? Yeah, I think if we've got if we've got a threshold, then we should stick by it. 4: Yeah, good, agreed. Um, number six, IEG. So, IEG have taken the risk committee through the 2025 status in terms of audits and also given an early notification of the draft plan for 2026. So, that was shared and discussed at Risk Committee. Project Orbit was discussed at board last meeting, and just to close the loop on that, that project is now live and has been successful in terms of implementation. So good to see that in place. Number eight, we're going to cover off later in the agenda here, so I don't propose to talk about that. 15: Number nine, there was a discussion at RISC Committee about data subject access requests, which is where individuals can ask to see any information that a company holds about them. So the RISC Committee approved the proposal, which was essentially that we would pilot allowing current employees a look back of a maximum of two years, but that wouldn't include information which the individual already had access to. And for any colleagues who've left the business, that that look back would be limited to two years. 22: So that's going to be piloted for 10 requests and then a decision made about let's continue in that vein. So that was... Does the law not say how far you can go back on it? So I've been involved in this in my data protection officer. According to the law, you need to go back and provide all information that you hold on an individual. There are exemptions to that. So for current employees, it makes perfect sense. They already have access to the data through their own email. We don't provide it. I think a key caveat with this is in most cases when someone is putting in a CEG DSAR, it will relate to a very specific concern that they have. So the aim would be to get to focus that concern down. And if they can't focus it down, say, look, here's the last two years, it's an important caveat that if they challenge that and say, no, I want more, CEG will give them the full quantity of data. So this is in effect a triage to try and satisfy their need and their right to access the immediate data. But if challenged, we will give them everything that they need. Okay. So that was it from the risk committee. Very good. Any questions for Keith? 6: Sorry, just on number five with the ERM dashboard, you said on the page the ERM team have requested their dashboards to present at board meetings moving forward. Are they going to be comfortable if we're just reporting stuff that the trigger says? 15: Well, it's a board decision, so we'll tell them. Yeah, yeah. Okay. 22: Okay. Thanks, Keith. Thanks, Suzanne. Good update. We're a little bit ahead. Can I suggest we do a compliance update and then have a break? Because I realised we're looking through the agenda just about a minute or so ago, there's no great picking money. We probably ate it for something else. But let's do a compliance update and then we can take a break. So, Joe, over to you. I think I can keep this hopefully reasonably brief. I don't think I need to touch on nitros. I think we'll be discussing that later. There was one action that we said I would speak to from the earlier actions, which was the unusual number of Hungarian PEPs that came out of the data from the last board meeting. My team has looked into that, and the answer is, if I'm being honest, slightly, we have an answer, but it's a slightly unsatisfactory answer. So, a large number of those PEPs are actually from American Express payments, not EPSOL, payment to Europe, rather, not EPSOL. And so, they should not have been contained in the data. GFCC is aware that there was an issue with their tracking and created some filters, but didn't, unfortunately, inform us that those filters were... They erroneously included them in our PEPS reporting. Yeah. So we are going to, as an action for this, at the next board meeting, provide some updated data to set out exactly. What's the number of things? So, how do we make sure that doesn't happen again? I think it's about sharing information widely between the GFCC when they're setting up their systems and how we collate the data. The other element is, you will have seen from my previous comments, we have reduced the quantity of data because there is, we're providing data that the board does not need to see, then these problems do not arise. And so, there is also managing it from a board point of view there. But they don't arrive, Joe, but it's also really important the people managing PEPS within EBITDA have accurate information. And I suppose when it came to the board, we spotted it wasn't accurate. So, I agree with you, it's good that the board only sees what they need to see. But it concerns me when they see stuff that's wrong and no one else has spotted that it's wrong. If you're removing that safety net, the board doesn't see it. But it's the issue is an issue with cadence, which may or may not come as a surprise, and the cadence mapping is incorrect. So, it's in the concerning that our system that manages all of our core compliance processes on top of Nitro. 16: It's not an official comment at the minute, Joe. 22: It is concerning. Probably I want to take very out at the moment, but it is concerning. The question is, what do you do about it? This is impacting all legal entities in Europe. But the point is that my point is, Cadence is the system that we had an issue with Nitro. Now we have this issue. What other issues are there we don't know about? 6: So, an action to follow up with. I don't know. Who is the owner of cadence? 22: It's GFCC. Speaker 7: I don't know why I'm looking at you in the market now. 22: It's someone in someone in GFCC. I'm pretty sure off Nitro we can track them down. They might be in hiding from us, but we can definitely find that out. There is a remediation plan. I think the issue here isn't, I mean, the issue is obviously comes in two parts. The first, that there is a problem with cadence miss mapping. The other that concerns me slightly more is no, they didn't appear to tell anyone. So. But it was us that spotted it. Yeah, the concern, I suppose, for the board is well, don't we? What else? 8: Can we rely on a system that is fundamental to running our business in a safe part? 22: And what else is there that we don't? Yeah, what else is there we don't know? That's we said isn't it no but yeah, yeah, but you said it much better. 9: Maybe the GFCC team can kind of give an update. 22: So to joke, is get a GFCC team to come and give an update about cadence. 8: That's a fair specific, like we just asked them to do an update on cadence. We'd specifically like to understand what's being done to remediate the issues that we've identified and then separately what are they doing to ensure that the system as a whole is operating effectively to give board reassurance. That's exactly what I was thinking. 9: That's actually reading your mind out to get that point. 22: And what you know, in this case, they knew about an issue, but like what else is on there? No issues literally. Oh yeah, no, not being chosen. He's been here six months, probably. What other issues? Okay, let's put this page. What other issues are on the known issues list, which would be helpful for us to understand. Yeah, cadence and GFCC. My suggestion is I or my team will take the action to find out who owns cadence and then there should be a second action for them, whoever they are, to come and bless them. That sounds lovely. I look forward to that. Actually, reading my mind, so what else is it? What else, Jay? So, we discussed the AML SLA breaches last time we came. Those are continuing. They are subject to a European-wide issue. So, this is a known concern that is affecting AML and sanctions investigations across Europe. And it has to do with the well, I won't read the slide, you can see it for yourself. But there is a plan, which is a get-to-green plan, which has been agreed by me and by Sylvia Marie to get us to green. The official get-to-green date is end of Q1. The less official one is sometime in February. So, we want to get it done faster. There is some risk associated with this, but ultimately, we are processing through the numbers and we're doing it on a risk-based approach. So, we are dealing with things as they come. There is, linking to our previous question, there is another issue, which is some of the root causes of this is that things have been stuck in holding queues and they've been blocked up in other parts of the systems. So, basically, it got stuck somewhere in a system in the US, and then it all got released unexpectedly to the team, which is why we were trekking along very nicely, and then suddenly a massive unexpected spike. So, that goes to the data and operation of our systems. Is that a nice concern? It's a very significant concern. Because, again, it goes to we can manage what we know. Yeah, if there's stuff not being sent down, I mean I'm presuming there was a file transfer, it's now file broke and someone realised there are all these cases that need to be worked and then released them manually and then wrote them and then fixed the automated link. But none of those cases were being worked while the files weren't being sent to you. Yeah, agreed. What are these? Are these alerts where we might have a sanctions match? What was the actual work that's being delayed? So when we have a it's exactly that and it's not just sanctions other when there's a potential match then that you need an investigation. The vast majority of cases result in nothing as you would expect but the fact we still need to work them and we still need to make our way through we're also applying some additional resource so we I've had an extra contractor come in who is pretty much exclusively working on this so we can try and work down the numbers. There is some comfort I would say at an enterprise level at the fact that an issue has been raised. That does not necessarily give me a great deal of comfort because an issue does not work the cases but from an internal governance point of view this is covered until the end of the year and I said I want to resolve that considerably faster. So the actual risk to the entity is we could be working with a sanctioned individual for longer than we would have intended through our processes. 15: Agreed. 3: Thought there'd be basic tech controls in to stop those things happening? Or trend analysis around okay if the volumes drop off or something like that? So you go back to the tech teams? 22: Yep so GFCC is also picking this up. I think Alex Redpath has been working on it to try and work out actually what is the root cause of some of this and part of the new issue management process is the identification of what is the RCA report analysis and how do we fix it for the next time. And an issue's being raised you said yeah. Yes it is. Is there a resource need, Joe? Like if you threw money at it would it be done quicker? The answer is probably not because the amount of time it takes to train people to get them qualified on our various systems and to do the work, there isn't. What I have done as part of the PART Green is I've implemented cross-training. So people who do work on other types of cases are now being trained on sanctions and other similar cases. So they already have access to systems, there are no difficulties in onboarding them. So we're trying to shift resources around a bit more flexibly. Good. What else, Joe? So we have an audit which I think started immediately before this onto the DPO function. That is currently midway through. So this is just FYI. It should conclude in January or February, and we'll get some results soon thereafter. Dan, noting in mind your request about an update on Easel. We should do that and we'll do that on the other side. Okay, great. In that case, I think another question for anyone for Joe. Not going to repeat this, so if anyone has any questions, please shall. 9: Joe, just on Project Aquarium, when they came and presented it, it was about moving entities into EASL. 16: Yeah. 9: And there were, we talked about whether they would, in the context of the broader KYC mediation work, they obviously were through it. Do we think there is KYC risk coming in through Aquarium? 22: So it's moving, Aquarium is moving some in and some out. In terms of KYC risk, these are firms that have still been KYC, just in a different jurisdiction under a different set of rules. So is there a risk? There is always some risk, but I think it is not a very significant risk. I think we're unlikely to accidentally onboard a very, yeah, someone who we would not necessarily. Want to do business with the act, do you think? No, so just because there's some outgoing merchants leaving EPSOR and there's merchants coming in, we cannot do all of the, we cannot load everything into the system of record prior to arrival in Epsil. So, what will happen is all the information will be collected, collated, they will arrive in Epsil. There will then be a delay of what I've been told about a week to two weeks maximum while the system of records are updated for those merchants that have arrived. You're going to collect the data before making the control and then refresh the data. That's the approach. And I've been told this two weeks. They've said a week, but maximum two weeks. Max has said first. It's not super volumes, it's just a very small volume. So it might be under a week. So there will be a small time period where we will have merchants that we have received and it will be live, but the system of records won't be updated. But we will have all the information. We won't receive anyone unless we have all the information. 8: But the vast majority that are moving into EAPSOL, we already have within Epsil. So it's just a legal name update. 22: But this will create pain for you, Veronic, in terms of merchants moving around because different jurisdictions and legal entities are going to work to different grids. And there's GCG merchants in the list moving around. 1: But I've asked Michelle and the compliance team as well as Lorraine to look at the needs for GCG accounts holistically. 22: Okay, good. Good. Any other questions for Joe? Good. Let's take a 10-minute break then. We can beat the welcome, Greg, and welcome Emmy. Speaker 20: Let's talk about KYC. Nice segue, Dan. I like it. So, in terms of the Action that I didn't respond on, which is 4.2, which relates to the payment controls issue that we discussed in the last board. And my action was to check whether servicing had quality assurance or control testing in place after the remediation, and that was carried out and has been carried out multiply. So, Colin met with Brenda. I believe Colin, you met with Brenda after the last board and aligned in terms of that, but in terms of the other action and the broader discussion that we had in the meeting. But there is quality assurance and quality control that was at the end. Great, good stuff. Okay, if we now move on to the update. So, page 52. That's the one. So, we can start here. So, the exec summary will go through detailed slides on each of these topics. So, from an acute, but a summary is as you can see that we're in good status. From an acute remediation standpoint, this is the mop-up activity and the residual activities to complete by end of this year, and they're on track to be completed. 22: So, you just say there's about 200 merchants aren't there, Greg. 20: You're going to come on to that. Absolutely. Yeah. For Artemis, they'll give an update on that one as well as for a refresh and backlog. And then Project Nitro and KPMG will give an update on that as well. So, if we can start to go through the pack, please. We can move to the next slide. So, from a regulatory date perspective, these are the commitments that we have in place today. Acute remediation mop-up is for the end of this year. The subsequent ones relate to low and medium risk backlog by the end of July 2026 and merchant migration to PAFAC, which is June 2026. And both of those. Are green amber, but they're more on the green than they are on the amber. 22: I think the only thing that makes them amber is the funding as soon as the fund, we took an action last week in the management meeting, it's still not approved. No. Okay. 20: So next slide. This is a summary in terms of the merchants that are remaining under a number of those categories. So you can see for acute remediation, this is as of middle of November, so this has progressed further still. From, as Dan said, we're down to the last couple of hundred here for the top activity, then for Artemis 1 and 2, as well as backlog, you can see that there is good progress being made in these activities now with the actual activity taking place. And Nitro has also made great progress in terms of the activity that's underway from a high risk and from medium and low. 22: So the critical thing for the board is acute remediation mop-up. That's linked to a regulatory deadline. And there's, I think there's less 53 pending there. 8: Yeah. Yeah, as of last week. 22: And Max confirmed to us on Friday that he has 100%, he bet his life, he's got 100% confidence he'll be able to solve for 53 by, I think he said the end of next week, didn't he? Next week, end of next week. So we should, we, I certainly, and a number of you were there at the management meeting where we reviewed this, feel confident that we can meet our acute remediation mop-up deadline. The other question I have is what assurance are we doing to check we've done what we think we've done on the acute remediation mop-up? Is that in scope for KPMG or not? 8: It's not in scope for KPMG but we have discussed it with Service saying that we will get a full essentially like QC done at the end and we will get a wrap-up. Report like in January to say we have checked everything that's gone through. Given that we've been tracking it down to this level, there's BioBeach does twice weekly meetings on it with Max and team. So I'm fairly confident that we haven't missed anything at this stage, but you never know. Speaker 18: Who's QCing? Sorry, did you say? 8: It's servicing. 18: They're QCing themselves. 8: We're QCing what the QC might not be the right one, but they're going to provide a report to check that everything's gone through. 18: I think it's a positive reporting more than QC. So this is a list of what we've done. 9: Is there someone that could check that going? Second line, maybe? 3: Second line. Maybe we should have a chat and then we can look at whether we do some spot check. I think it's worth doing some spot checks. Maybe at that level, yeah. 100% check. Yeah, I agree. 22: I mean, there were obviously multiple, multiple projects across the Q mediation mock-up. It's not one initiative with multiple work streams. So it's just, I think, probably worthwhile doing some spot checks to check if we've done in January. So we have total confidence. Yeah. Agreed. I think we will get our deadline. I think it's very reasonable for us to do a check afterwards. I think there is a question for us as to what happens if we find problems with that, but we can deal with that as and when we come to it. Yeah, and we deal with it when we come to it. I mean, I think I'd probably push it to KPNG because they're already in on there. The second thing to call your attention to is Nitro. That's obviously where we needed to achieve within from when we had the issue to cleaning up the high-risk or refreshing high-risk merchants within 90 days. So that deadline is fast approaching as well. And I think the latest this morning is we are down to there's two merchants, PayPal's Resolve, PayPal's Resolved Institute of Civil Engineers, I think is being sold. I think there's one other merchant I've seen. Some emails flying around with your team this morning, which is Sim John's hospital in Sim John's window. There's a trustee that's air mister Archmode County that doesn't want to give us details to us. So we just need to sort that out. 8: But I think we're confident that the cancellation file will be sent on Thursday, which means the cancellation will be run this weekend or we will be able to run away. 11: So just from the standpoint, as about Nitro, 51 will be cancelled? Very easy. 8: 51 is that means they're either pending the SLR update, so they've been completed and they're waiting for CARSIC to update this record, or they are pending cancellation because they might have said that they actually want to be cancelled, they're not using time layers, etc. 11: And out of family standards then what you were saying for your forum though? 8: Yes, yes, so this was obviously two couple of weeks ago that this was submitted. 22: One of the issues with this is with a fast-moving project like Nitro papers are submitted three weeks. It's important you get this within minutes though. These papers were submitted three weeks ago plus the projects moving, you know, stuff's moving on a daily basis. So the numbers look very when we looked at them for the next year. 11: It's 17 November and we are on 9th. So yeah. 22: Okay. 6: On Artemis 1.0 given that's got December deadline there's still quite a lot on this schedule in progress and not started sort of. 8: So yeah the thousands not started are due to a macro so it's very quick remediation. Since this has been submitted there are 800 left of those 230,000 to sorry 2300. That 800 are being run literally this week so they will be complete by end of the week and so I'm I have no concerns on artificials. 22: Could I make a suggestion? Can we take from the Friday management meeting and just recirculate to the board the latest MIS just so you've got a view of where we are and can look at Julia where we were and where we are. Just to be clear also on Artemis, there's no regulatory deadline set to that. We actually said the middle of the HD was easy to July or June, which is the June one for the middle of next year. But it's just a two-phased project, so you want to make sure we're obviously in the first six months we've chunked out the first half of it. 9: Maybe also after the next AML committee meeting, just because of the deadlines at the end of December, just circulate all the updates over there with that page so that they can see that it's happening. 20: Okay. Greg, Ellie, back to you. Okay, we've kind of covered some of the next content we're going to go through. So the next slide is regarding the acute remediation residual activities. So as Dan just said, I think we should include this one as well from the Friday meeting because this will obviously agree. That's a really good point, Greg. Yeah, we'll include that as well. And to be honest, we should probably do that going forward because these numbers do move fast moving items. So we've covered these. This will be, we're 100% confident that this will be closed off in time. And if we go into the next slide, then it's Artemis and over to you, Ellie. 8: Yeah, so I think we've materially covered Artemis, but in terms of Project Artemis 1.0, so the ones that were scheduled to finish by the end of this year, all the batches have now completed. We're just working through cancellation files. For any that have not completed their KYC, those cancellation files are in hand and getting more to servicing. There have been some delays with us getting additional data like complex grosses and pay addendas, which was a complication we weren't expecting, but we've managed to obtain that data both for Nitro and Artemis. So no concerns in terms of any of the ones within outreach. And then as I just updated, the macro is moving smoothly. Most of them are completely about 800 to go and that is being run I think today or tomorrow. So we have no concerns with that. Completion of Artemis 1.0. Artemis 2.0 has begun and that is on track. I think we're on batch three of Artemis 2.0. So that started in September and that will run through to June next year. That's all running to plan. We've got it resourced into next year. We're just waiting on the confirmation of funding for next year. That's the only risk and that's why it's tracking it at the slash green. But other than that, it is in plan. There's a smaller number of cases that need to be solved by a macro, and we will get that done while we've got the macros running. So we're likely to actually get a macros done this year for Artemis 2.0. 20: Okay, so this one is the summary of the UK KYC backlog and where we are from a low and medium risk case completion. So this shows the burn down of the planned case initiation and then the forecast of when they will be completed. Because there is a life cycle to when these are initiated to when they complete, this is to track that we will have completed by the end of July, which is our regulatory deadline. And at the moment, we're still mapping towards that being completed around the late May, early June period. But the key for that is that we've initiated cases on time because each of these cases has a scheduled lifespan. So we'll provide this on a free board update so you can see our plan and where we're tracking against that. 22: The other thing I think is very important, Greg, to provide is how many merchants are we actually cancelling and how much DBV is actually being cancelled. Because when I looked at the management reporting here, we're cancelling quite a lot of DBV on backlog. No, like millions, tens of millions. 12: Well, we know that because we talked about that at the end of the day, there's a lot that hasn't been. 22: The SAM team are going to obviously switch. Their activities, but you know, when you when you're seeing tens of millions of DBV going out the door, you know, do we have the right amount of resources? Are we focusing on enough? My anecdote would be: I think that the Nitro project obviously took up a lot of focus from the team and the SAN team, and maybe the backlog didn't get as much focus, which is why we've been cancelling more merchants. I'm in Madrid tomorrow, Thursday, I'm part of my plan in Madrid tomorrow, and Thursday is to really make sure the SAN team are across the backlog, and we're doing everything we can to close out those cases. Not only to get the information from the merchants, but also to minimise the impact to the business from DBV, and then volume being cancelled, and the corporate is not being able to use their card merchants. 11: So, is it right that the cancelled already cancelled is 26 million, and then do you have it on the previous page? Do you do it for cancellation or the 17 million? 22: That's Artemis, that's different projects. That's fast. 11: You're talking Nitro. 22: No, I'm talking backlog. So, we've got the acute remediation lock-up, we've got the Nitro high-risk, then we've got Artemis, and then we've also, I know there's a lot of projects, we've got the backlog. So, the backlog, just to take a few steps back, just to remind everyone we're the merchants that we did not refresh during acute remediation because we were remediating, not refreshing. So, we paused refresh. We then got the refresh going again, and we need to complete the refresh by the mid-backlock, we need to clear the backlog by the middle of next year. My point is, there's quite a lot of DBV being cancelled as a result of the backlog being worked as it's worked in batches. 12: If you've got the latest number, you're talking about already cancelled or scheduled for cancelling. 22: Well, they're in batches, so they work batches, right? So, GSG and SAM work batches through. And when you look at batch one. To what's been cancelled. The number is it would be interesting. 8: Yeah, we've got, I mean, we're talking, I don't know, CBV, we've got eight. 22: Yeah, it's like 40, it's 30 plus 40 million. 8: I mean, there's 1100 merchants scheduled for cancelling, and I'm concerned about what's coming as well. 12: Yeah, we've been in delays, and so I think we need to get like, Dan, right, like Nitro had like we had a very short-term need to solve for those by the end of this year. But I think we need to sort of accelerate efforts to back up because we need to get Federal focus on the backup again, but also having the right reporting in oversight, like where we see delays. 22: We have great reporting, and it's showing how many merchants we're cancelling, and it's a lot of DVD. 8: I don't think we're getting accurate live reporting, but that's something that we're following. We're picking up, I spoke to Alistair about it, we're having how much have we cancelled? Batch 1, 2.9 million, batch 2, 27.5 million, batch 3, 0.3 million, batch 4, 8 million. 22: Yeah, so that's nearly 40. I mean, what's that 830? 40 is in. 8: Batch 4, 0.8 million, just scheduled. 22: Right. And the next batch. 31 million. 31 million. When you look at the next batch and the volume in the next batch, it's got massive volume in it. Okay. 8: We've still got time to save. 20: I know we have. And we do, because ultimately the regulatory deadline is the 31st of July. So let's look at that separately and see what we can come up with for a plan. 8: That's also not including servicing numbers. That's just that. 20: How much is servicing? 8: Do you know how much is scheduled for cancellation and servicing? 20: I don't know. I don't know where this phase is. It's all the lower DVD items, but we'll see. 22: Just through like 35 million as well. But we can't afford those types of cash. Cancellation rates on the next batch is just too much impact for business. I know that's why I was so worried. Okay. So, what's the action from that? 8: The action is we are meeting with the team to run through anything. So, the cause of the delay is that we pulled the tenured contractors onto Nitro and we've had to then backfill new people into the backlog because we needed to operationalize Nitro so quickly. So, that has caused delay in that. No regulatory outreach has been missed. Like, all of the comps have gone out for marketing, but the SAM agent hasn't then done a personal follow-up with the merchant, which they should have done had it gone scheduled. So, we are meeting, it's going to be a weekly call to discuss anything that hasn't been upreached of where we are to get back on track. And if needed, we spend a deadline from those merchants that haven't had. 12: Because you don't have a deadline of like the 5th of January. 22: No, they don't have to be aware of that. 12: But we don't want to create more of a backlog. 22: Yeah, okay. All right, good. Let's move on. 8: Okay, so Project Nitro, I think we've talked about high-risk. So, high-risk is on track to finish by the 31st of December. At this stage, we have no concerns for either cancellations or SOR being completed by then. So, we're comfortable with how that's moving. For medium and low-risk, we have now started the outreach. So, batch one is live. There is a risk that we have uncovered in the last couple of days in the data that a number of merchants within the data have been signed within the last two years, so should not be in the medium and low risk data because they would be KYC on boarding and they would not come up from KYC years. We don't know. That is being, there was discussion this morning, and so that begs the question: is the data correct? It's not. 22: I mean, we say it was in the data they were signed here in June. So they wouldn't, excuse me, no one would be due for refresh and not even high risk. I know whiz air can't be high risk, are they? Speaker 17: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, onboarding and then time of sense right flight back yesterday. 22: This is all cadence data from correct. It feels like everything points back to cadence. I know we drafted over it, but yesterday we dealt with this PayPal issue and as Joe said it turned out that someone in France had erroneously tagged this NIDS and then it was like it didn't wasn't even high risk. I also say the refresh team last year I went through the guy's worksheet for high risk and there was snappy snap. You heard the story snappy snaps on not in Nicebridge which is not an anti-it was listed as an antique shop. It's not so it will I mean all roads seem to point back to the same place don't they? I think all the roads point back to data not on the cadence. It's data quite a bit there are issues in cadence but cadence only is good as the data it's just got in it. 9: I think the comfort that we need on nitro is that if there are things in there that shouldn't be in there are there things not in there that shouldn't be in there. 22: That's a pretty good point. I think we don't have questions about whether the data is correct based on what you said we know it isn't correct so it's what are we going to do to identify the root cause of why it's not correct. And then as you say it's both sides of that taking some out which is great it might be do we need to but if we need to put another couple of hundred in to high risk that's not good is it no as I mean that's definitely not obviously of consequences. 12: I thought we did do that exercise though when Nitro came up and we talked about the populations kind of pulled out that there'd be any more. 8: We did work off the data that we were given. At the time. 22: But you're only as good as the data you're given. Yeah, you can't know what you don't know. We've got the Abby's one of the best data people we've got in GMS, isn't he? 8: No, he's not going to be. 22: He's working with it, but I mean, even his team don't seem to be able to explain some of the stuff that's happening. I mean, Chris, you've been in all these meetings, what you're. Well, I mean, at the moment, they're looking into it from a data point of view. 17: It sounds like they're overestimated rather than to the hollow point, actually, mister Data, etc. So, like you say, we do that route cost to work out why. 22: They've been too cautious, they've included too many merchants and so on. So, they put with air into the song for whatever reason versus we didn't include a merchant that should be. 17: Well, how do we know what is that cheap? That's being locked into. That's been looked into as well. So, they're trying to do all of the data analysis to look back at the methodology that they use and then look through that to look at these specific cases. Oh, yeah, to concept. 22: I mean, it's a good question, Susan. How do you know? When we think we know, we don't know. 8: KPMG are looking at that as well. I was one of that class. How do we look at the right population in Nitro? So, that's nice. 22: KPFG is in their scope. 8: It's in their scope to say, have we got the right population in Nitro? And rerunning. 22: They have all the raw data. They have their own data team running the data to check our work. Do you know the outcome remind me? I know. January. I think from this one, as a board, we've had an issue raised to us. We've identified it and we've asked for some work to be done. So I think it's probably best for us to, having asked that work to be done, to wait for the overview. On a secondary point related to this, a piece of data. We won't have now, we probably won't have for some months. That would be very useful to know for the board's oversight: is from the medium and low risk, how many, if any, of those merchants shift from being medium or low risk up to high risk? Well, and the other way, how many shift from medium avoidant medium to become low? Yeah, a read. I think the medium to low up to high, which is obviously more aware we've been taking an active, well, an active risk has been taken over the past period. So, if that's a piece of data that we can get and it doesn't need to be of now now, it can be once the work is done. I think that's a useful data point for us to understand. 20: Okay, okay, I've taken that one away. 8: Um, okay, any other question, Nitro? 6: I guess, Joe, have you seen anything that's changed the position with the FCA? 22: Uh, so at present, no. We made the call a number of months ago now that this would be the thoughtful that we will keep a watching brief. A number of issues have arisen over the period, but they've all been addressed, so I don't think there's anything that would any new events that would cause us to reconsider that at the moment. 17: And from an other market perspective, there is no change from the views market by market, none of them speak to the regulator. 22: The next decision point would be in January time when we get the KPMG work back, the checking work, the spot checking work. Um, that would be the next decision point around. Is there another discussion that needs to be had with the regulator? Because that might give rise to wider issues you'll need to think about. 8: Okay, okay, so moving on. 20: That's the last one. Oh, no, sorry, K. Sorry. 8: Um, so again, since. This slide was submitted, there has been a change to the timeline on the slide. So the timeline has shifted, and we now expect final report to come through at the end of January due to problems that KPMG have experienced in trying to map the data they require to complete their sample checking. 22: We are now doing that. They basically spent, I mean, I spoke to Peter Times, Chris, myself, Eddie, many of us being on calls. It's very clear their first audit finding is going to be even if they were put in on a section once they see it's where they're regulated, we couldn't get the data. It took us weeks to get the data in which and we still haven't got it. 8: Is it access or it's not? 22: Partly access, partly it's not in one place. 8: Just mapping. It's like mapping where to get. So what they're trying to do is get every single field that is required for EDDs enhanced due diligence to be able to then check if the person's going through enhanced due diligence if we've got every single data point to map some of those. So to get the kind of simplified due diligence data points, we've got there and we're fine, they've started that work, but we're still waiting on a number of fields within EDD and basically no one because of all the different systems. We're on different systems, no one can tell us which like tables they're in in Lumi. It's not a pulling issue. Someone could tell us like pull from this table in Lumi, we can pull it. But it's like a we have no like central ownership or like data mapping. There's no one to go to to be like where do I get this data. 22: The way Peter described it to me is it was a treasure hunt to get data whereas it should be because the holes though so nothing it would be don't worry. 8: And we know we have feed issues where we've got like something in input into Genesis that's not pulling through in a Lumi table. So there's like there's a multiple. 22: Yeah we need to wait for their report I think when we'll obviously probably get them to come and present the summary of their report as well. But that's where we got them in, right? Because we wanted to find these things, we wanted to look, we wanted to have external assurance. So, this is all helpful stuff that we're going to have to work on and take away. I think there's a follow-up question to that as well, which might wait till January. But is there anything else that we use Lumi for that might knowing that our approach to data mapping and data governance is perhaps not what it could be, that would have an impact on any other processes? 8: I mean, like 100%, it has an impact on all of the data for all projects, because that's where we have to model the baseline data. 22: So, what's the kind of the greater impact of all of this? What do you mean? Well, we've identified this during the course of this single piece of work. This potentially is a much broader project. 11: There's already one where I understand on all the. 22: Yeah, there's also some data stuff coming across the enterprise as well. 17: Yeah, so there's the data, I think Emily under Mindy's the data officer now for GMNS, and there are lots of different issues and OREs linked to data. It's probably been one of them across the enterprise that have been locked out. 22: So how KPFG's findings will link into that, we don't know, but I'm sure there'll be some over that. I mean, if some of that could perhaps help with the prioritisation of that random, so other than the data issues, they are progressing. 8: So they've now got like most of the remaining fields. They're just waiting on these like niche fields from EDD, but they're able to progress with their analysis on like the cases that don't have to go through EDD. So it's not blocking the overall project moving forward, but it is mopping up a portion of the analysis that they need to do. And that's why the timeline has been moved out to Mr. 22: Expected Flight. And any initial thoughts for them after the data? Yes, I can't remember this. 15: Yeah. Okay. But that would imply no. It's been a bit painful to get there, as we've heard, but there's no alarm bells being rung about quality of what's happened up to a lot of resistance. 8: No, I think so. 22: So I think there are keys, but I think we should wait till we've got the full report. I think there's, yeah, let's wait till we get the full report, let's kind of pre-judge what's going to happen. And when we get the report in January, we'll have to look out how we manage it. That's what we wanted them to do. So that's what they've done. Okay. Any other questions? Very good. Thanks, Greg. Thanks. 20: Thanks a lot. Cheers. 22: Chris, lists. Yes, copy that. 8: It was my second ULAP project. That's the last one. The camera didn't work. So I've had sick people looking at some of the things that I've waited for about 12 hours because I should be. And then I got the new one. 22: Maybe they'll give you a recondition one the first time. 8: Apparently not, but it should be fine. 22: Christmas jumper dates though. Yeah, I guess remember. We all did well. 9: I didn't know. 22: I knew about that. 9: I did get that though. I hope we've got places it's not always going to went to school. That's it. I think it was a bit of a box. Speaker 21: Double check. 9: Let's say Susanna. 6: She was. 22: She broke my twice. Yeah. Okay. Let's talk consumer duty. We don't have consumers. 8: So moving on to consumer duty. So, looking at the exact summary, point number one, we've closed three actions since the last board meeting. Those are the independent reviews of the fair value assessment, independent review of disputes, and the annual board report. And then we've added a number of actions and renamed all the actions so that we will have consistent tracking across the boardx going on. So I'll go into kind of the specifics of those actions on the next slide. Number two, the uplift of fair value sounds historically. 22: Yeah, and we'll go through the timelines and we'll go through and give you guys a quick project update in terms of where we're at and basing off the timeline to March 2026. So we'll go into more details in the later slides. Great. 8: So item number three, the current proposal for in-scope segments for consumer duty and fair value is under review. We've actually, since this has been submitted, had that approved by MCO. So we've got a new target market definition for consumer duty and that reduces, I mean, in essence, reduces the DBV threshold that we've considering in scope for the duty from 250k to 100k DBV, and that's based on external research. And because the FCA's definition is a micro enterprise which is under 10 employees or under a 1 million turnover, we don't have a way to check that with every single merchant. And so we've had to make some assumptions of that definition. 11: That would be boring last week. But is that approved by Observatory that they have given in builds and dubs of additional documentation which needs to report? 22: Yeah, I think under the new structure we would give advice that we do not we are content with it, which I believe we are, we wouldn't necessarily approve. 8: Yeah, fine, yeah, and there are some parameters to that. So we've got additional documentation. 22: This is just adding to what Ellie said, I think this is a relatively important point. There is a risk if we take too broad a view of who is within the consumer duty scope that we end up skewing our interpretation of what a micro enterprise is and what their needs are. So by bringing it down to the area that we think is genuinely covered by the consumer duty with a reasonable margin for error on top, which is, I believe, what we have done, that means we should be targeting the correct group of merchants who would fall under the definition of a consumer for the purposes of the FCA regulations. 8: And this work will then inform the documentation on public market, the service briefing document, which we have to do each year, and the mapping of our customer needs and journeys, which was a risk that was called out at the recipient that we are working on. Item number four, relating to vulnerable customer initiatives, again I'll provide more detail on this in the deck, but in terms of the initiatives they're progressing well, we've launched large for font statements. And that is now live across the UK merchant base. We've got an interim solution in place, and that is documented in a CHC article, so that relates to one of the border actions from last board for CCPs to read out statement information over the phone whilst Braille is still being finalised. We're working through the PRA and the TLM for that, which is substantial and will push us into Q1 next year to launch Braille statements. There's a quick question on stuff like this that we do. 9: So when we launch a Braille statement, obviously consumer duty is identified as something we need to do. If you're a large merchant that doesn't fall into the scope of consumer duty, you could still get a braille statement. 8: Yeah, so this is actually under the excess discrimination. Exactly. The Equality Act. So it's available under Consumer Duty. It's available. Yes, anyone. And the merchants are informed via, so their onboarding packs will be updated when they're signed. So when they want to honour teams, send out onboarding. And they will also be informed on DMX banner, saying that they're now available. And then in the future, we've put in for a tech build for them to sell for the first time within DMX. 9: Field sales should probably be aware of it. 15: I think there's more to do as well around awareness. Later in the pack, there's a CG update about training, and less than half of colleagues who should have undertaken UK customer training have undertaken it. Which suggests we've got a bit of work to do. Or we've only half the deadline. Yeah, it doesn't say when the deadline was. I assume it was end of November with everybody else. It wouldn't be. How was that assignment? Speaker 13: No, not going to be the last thing. 15: If it's not the only time you're 9: There's a whole bunch of rules. 22: It's notably like everything else in the 90s, that particular bit of training might be recently. Okay, alright, we'll take that out again. It's been a deadline. 8: Okay, so moving on to the next slide. So, this is a summary of all of the ongoing consumer duty activity. I won't go through every single action on here, but I'll pull out a couple. So, one of the things that CDA1 that is now complete is the independent compliance testing done by the second line. So, that tested the release of funds journey. That has completed, and more findings were identified from that. Most of them relate to the actual process themselves and so that it's servicing for remediation in terms of us not following the correct procedure and storing PVD checks on merchants to release funds. And one relates to kind of the tracking that's available within the merchant activity. 3: That VVD one was interesting, wasn't it? Because there was assertion by the audit team was that it was a mandatory check that had to be done in every circumstance. Basically, our policies say in certain circumstances you can do this, in other circumstances, you can do that. So, the processes don't line up with what the audit team were saying was the foreign laws. I mean, we can change the processes to make it mandatory every time, but they're set up as they're set up now. So, there's the team reviewed the policies and processes and tested against those. 22: I think there probably is a not necessarily a gap through what the tester did between what one set of things says and what another set of things says. So, there is a degree of alignment that's needed there. 3: Yeah, it seems like it might have been a lot of misalignment between what regulations require and what our policies dictate. We're working within the policies that we've got, the processes view followed because they just don't maybe meet that whole need, and that's something we need to look at. 8: Yeah, the other item I'll call. Out from this, there's been a huge amount of work done on refreshing the MI in consumer duty off the basis of a third-party review that was done in Easel by PA Consulting and advised them on it on a load of uplifts to do. So we have used that as a base and uplifted our MI. And in the process of getting that sign-off and our outcome statements, we actually moved the management of MI to the merchant outcomes forum so it won't come to the board for full sign-off, but we will be covering it for next year for that. 22: Well, then if we miss this threshold to preach, yes. 8: Any other questions on the page? So moving on to the next page, again, I think a lot of this is kind of ongoing VAU and some of it's been pushed into 2026 as we start to plan into next year. Sam will talk more about the Fair Valley uplift shortly and I'll also speak about the accessibility uplifts as well. So I don't think there's anything specifically to call out here. Yeah. 22: So as you guys may be aware, so sorry, just one thing of disputes, can we go back to that? Because that was something we talked about a lot last week. 8: Yes, fine. So the disputes, PA Consulting led an independent review of our disputes process. What they found from that review, and I think we presented those findings at a prior board meeting, is essentially that the process itself didn't have, like, we didn't have process issues, but potentially there were uplifts that we needed to make in communications that the merchants receive, the data that we're able to get and track to assess where actually there is a problem within dispute. We think one of the problems might be merchants actually using the dispute portal DMX, like getting them into the portal to even be able to respond to disputes. And so we are doing a full uplift. Of the disputes process. So, Sarah and my team has put together a three-part project plan which will uplift. So, for the first case, we will uplift all of the communications on the website. For example, there were errors within the website saying that we still had the facts option for disputes, which we don't. So, we have factually corrected the website and the communications that go out to merchants ahead of the end of this year. And then we are planning a full refresh of the disputes guide for merchants, making it brittle super easy for small merchants and revamping the video that's available for small merchants. And we will be looking across data. We're in the process of getting all the data for disputes and looking at that into next year, and we'll come back with the office. 22: Things like the disputes guide on the website was over 10 years old. Yeah. Which is fine if it was right, but it's the problem with it being 10 years old. So there's a lot of work to do there. 8: That's great, though, because we've identified one of those issue. So that's a really good example of something where we've identified an issue. And actually, the MI caused us to find that because we consistently were breaching the threshold of the MI. So that's what made us. 22: Then we listed some calls, then we got peer consultants to do the work, and now we're facing the process. 7: That's a really good story. Yeah. 22: When it comes to FEA, we have so far defined the FEA principles as of October of this year. Do you want to take a step back? Does anyone remember what we're doing with fair value assessments? 6: Well, the last board meeting, I think we were still talking about what principles we defined. 22: Just so just take a step back and we'll find it for what we're doing. Yeah, so we originally ran a fair value assessment back. 21: In March of this year, which then we took a 2PA consultant for a review and they gave us a wholesale action plan to revise the FEA principles. 22: And what we've done is with all of the business teams, so Keith, I think, and also GCO and with MCO, we're in a room together to actually work through the FEA principles. And we've pulled together 10 guiding principles on assessing whether or not we are pricing our merchants fairly and are we delivering the value to our merchants based on the price that they pay. And where we are at right now is with the agreed principles, we are first going through to understand where how we're going to evidence based on the principles that we have set out. So we've been working with the business enablement team and all of the business units, so for example, servicing and acquiring network teams, to actually understand if we were to evidence the principles based on what we've set out, do we have all of the data points to back up those specific principles and then whether or not we're delivering value? So there will be a valuation point to each of those data points that we are producing to actually understand if the value we're offering to our merchants is fair. Concurrently, we are also working on the target market, so to understand the target market of merchants in scope. So originally we set out a less than 250k threshold. Using competitive information from the KEE report, we were able to make assumptions on the share of till 4 annex acceptance to then set out the new threshold. What our proposal is is to reduce the fair value threshold from 250k to 100k to actually better 21: To reflect the in-scope merchants as to who truly should be in scope for this assessment. 22: We're going through the compliance feedback right now. 21: There are certain risk mitigation that we need to put in place before actually using this data set, just because there are things that we've applied assumptions on that we need to clearly document and define out. 12: How much does that shrink the population? 22: Yeah, it's around like 20,000 merchants that we can remove from the overall population. 21: Yeah, so what we've done is we took the entire base of the UK and then we stripped it all down. 22: We removed our governments, we removed our airlines and we then grouped them based on the top chain volume to determine how big they are. And then we're left with the less than 100k merchants right at the end and that is the in-scope merchant we have in scope. What that does mean though is that we have been able to exclude out some of those GCG franchisees from the overall assessment. 21: We do have the likes of Londi, Super Safans and etc. who is still in our convenience more USR. 22: So it has helped us understand our landscape a little bit more by just spending the time on the target market. 1: Sorry I didn't catch this when I was the fair value assessment was the whole point was to show that the franchisees within GCG was getting better value than a small merchant although they were about similar size. So why would we exclude them? 11: So let me take a step back. So the fair value assessment is to demonstrate that the most Merchants in scope for consumer duty are being charged the fair price for the services or the value delivered. Then came the next question: what about franchisees? Because we had not included franchises in our initial assessment. When you look at the franchisees and you then try to assess the population in scope by reducing the target market to more accurately reflect the true small merchants, some of the franchisees are no longer in scope. And those franchisees typically happen to be GCT franchisees. And we can walk you through the definitions, etc., so that you have a table. But now the target population for fair volume assessment has reduced to reflect more accurately what should be treated as small merchants as part of consumer duty. And that does not include lots of franchisees, but definitely all of GCT franchises. 1: And if you do that, Shachi, you are only left with the small merchants, right? So you no longer have a problem because they are all eligible for small merchant pricing. 11: Not just all of them. There are some types of claude, etc., who are still falling under the 100K revenue threshold, which will be in scope. But the pricing is different. And the price is. 8: Even if you were left with just SP, you would still have to abstract value. That is abstract value. That's the correct price. 1: And is it what we are trying to achieve, Shachi? I mean, because I thought the whole point was to show that if a merchant, like a franchisee was a GCG or a Starbucks or etc., were paying a much higher rate than small merchants, we wanted to show that we were delivering more value to those merchants. Therefore, we justified a higher price. So if you exclude them, I mean, I don't mind at all, but if you exclude them, you no longer prove that point, right? 11: The point was never whether it was GCG or whether it was non-GCG. Was what is in school cost module? Are we pricing them fairly based on the value and services delivered? So, if in score there's a GCG franchisees, yes, absolutely, we have to defend it. If it is a large market, we have to deliver it. So, it's not segment-specific, but it's the moduled size specific. 22: But we've removed them anyway, so it's removed the property. Because it doesn't fall under consumer duty, we've shown that we've solved the topic in a different way. 9: Sorry, the point I was just going to make was: I didn't spot this when I was looking through the decks beforehand, that you've gotten the slide sign-off from compliance, legal, and sponsors. I think we would both say we're going to provide advice or be consulting. 8: The sponsors will sign off if you're deploying. Sorry, I didn't spot that in. 22: Good. So, then for Q1 next year, once we've addressed the compliances, risk modification factors, sign-offs, and from sponsors, we would then start the work, which is to pull together all of the information and start building out the justification based on the principles that we have set out. And that will be working with Servicing and CLM teams to make sure that we can pull together to answer the questionnaire that's been provided by PA consultant. And then, finally, when we come to March, is when we'll be pulling together the FEA documentation, like the ones you guys have previously seen on the last FEA that we've completed. Okay? 6: So, at the high level, what are the principles that we're anchoring against for this? 21: So, some of the things we're looking at is whether or not we're not making a significant amount of revenue or profit from a specific report version. 22: So, we're looking at the industry at the segmentation, i.e., which channel acquisition channel do they come from, and understanding the rate that we're charging versus the value we're delivering. Does it actually stack up based on the segmentation that they want to use? 11: There's a set of ten principles. So, what happened is when PN issued the report, PA said you don't have a principle, you don't have your principle that you want to follow, you don't have a defined approach. How are you going to approach this? And then you don't have the right level of evidence and several other feedback as well. So, the first thing we did was align all the principles, which is a set of ten principles. If you want, we can share it across with the entire board with that is helpful. But broadly, principles are defining how are we looking at intermediaries, how are we looking at, you know, how are we measuring, how are we ensuring that the services that we think we are offering are actually being used, as an example, by the small consumers or small merchants. So, it's a set of ten things, don't remember Doc, but we can circulate. 6: So, we're looking at the value trying to value what we're providing to them as opposed to the amount it's costing us. 22: Yes. It's all about their perspective. It is. 11: But as part of evidencing, at some point, we might have to like one of the things is it's all assumed very pure vanilla that this is the cost, this is the margin we are, therefore, this is the price we're charging. That's not really how we price. We don't know cost-based pricing, we do value-based pricing. So, that's the shift we're doing. 22: Okay. Any other questions? 8: Sorry. 22: That's a good one. Yeah. 8: Okay. So, vulnerability and accessibility. So, I think I spoke to most of this earlier. So, we've now got the vulnerability flag is live. There is training for all the CCPs who are managing that with that tagging, and they've had that training. And we have four more vulnerability training. Additional vulnerability training rolling out the CCPs. It's actually been delayed until December due to staffing issues of the vulnerability project. Within accessibility, as I've been mentioning, the large print statements have now launched. That's been announced to all the merchants, and we have already had one customer sign up for large prints, so we do know that the process works, which is good. Rail statements, we're going through the process of TLM and PRA, so that will come in Q1 2026. And the text reader solution, which is an RCM that's open, which will now fall into my team, is expected to go live in Q4 2026. So these interim solutions are in place ahead of that solution coming in, which was delayed due to text. 22: But to the conversation earlier, this is not necessarily consumer duty orientated. This should have been in place anyway under the Disability Discrimination Act. Yes. I mean, the question I have is just taking a few steps back, I think it's worth us just understanding the RCM process. Again, how that works. Because obviously, this is a good example. This obviously was a long time ago. I think the Disability Discrimination Act was 1995, 1995, thank you. But I think it'd be good for the board to understand the RCM process, how it worked, because obviously there's a number of things that have come along that we've heard about later after the attestation is in force, or sometimes, you know, often a long time after it's published, but before it's in support. So I don't know if that's something the board would want to think about, or not, or it's just me. I think RCM is a question that is being considered in Easel at the moment. I think it's a good question. It might be one that we might. Consider with, or Dan, you and I can discuss offline as to whether it's worthwhile us doing our own look at it or going session. Yeah, I just think it's just what's the problem. The process is the same across both legal entities, so the same presentation, isn't it? 4: Last time we discussed it, there was AI was being introduced, and there was a tool, but I assume that tool has had some TVs. 22: Yeah, so that was kind of done something else. Be helpful to hear. Yeah, I think it would be. And we obviously rely, you know, forward-looking. Obviously, a lot of what the board spends their time doing is looking at stuff right now, but forward-looking, scanning the horizon, co-rely on that information coming in, so we can then, you know, back early. As a suggestion, given that we're identifying that this is a potential risk, perhaps if we come first to the risk committee and then the risk committee can take a view as to whether it needs to be escalated, good. Okay. Good. Anything else, Ellie? Thank you very much. Back at time, unlike Holly's train this morning, which in Space Central, it would have all been fine. Let's get some lunch. We've got a 20-minute break and then we'll start again at resilience. Not Generation Z being resilient or operation. 15: Redro's earlier comment: are we plugged into a particular area that we're being worked on from an EPSOR perspective? Yeah. 22: I think the concept of operational resilience was more around it, it was raised, it was the latest a little does that have implications for EAPSOR? Well, just to say, coming back to what I said around the RCM process, around why wasn't I spotted earlier? Yeah. I think immediately with OP-Res, we're in a good place. I think the issue was more the fact that it was a bit of a rush. Gotta get in. 12: There was a method. It was raised. Easel had. 22: Yeah. 12: This was going back probably 24 months ago now. 22: Yeah, 2022. Yeah. Yeah. 12: Yeah. 22: Okay. Okay. That's good. 8: Okay, so operational resilience. Item number one: update to the plan. So we've got most risk management activities that have to be completed in 2025 complete. That includes the mapping review, self-assessment, the cyber tests have happened since the last board, and MI uplift within the IBSs is complete. We have just gone through a process of reviewing all of the business services that we've not declined as important, so those also have to be reviewed to ensure there's no material changes to those. And that is on track for completion. And we'll come to the next board for sign-off. Special review has commenced with IAG. We have, well, the planning phase has commenced and we have submitted, I think, over 60 documents to IAG. We're in discussion with them and the kickoff, formal kickoff is on the 16th next week. 12: And this is just for everyone's, this is an audit that's across both entities. It's an audit that's yeah, a special review across each level. But there is going to be a distinction in the reporting of the findings between the two entities. So each one will be assessed independently. Yeah. Which I think is important. 8: So we're in the phase of having started planning into 2026 and I've included in the deck key activities online as we look into 2026. So we'll look at that more. Item number three is the summary of vulnerabilities. So we've made good progress across closing out some of our vulnerabilities against MI and the GMAS launch in November for the UK market. We've identified a number of new vulnerabilities that have come through the delayed payments incident which we had to report to the FCA, sorry, under the PSD2 regulations to the FCA. And that was due to a backs file being submitted late, which meant that merchants had a one-day payment delay following the it wasn't related, it was related but not a direct result of the GMAS implementation. That's right. Item number four, Matt will cover in more detail, which is the legal assessment. We are now complete across the legal assessment for transaction IBS, and he will update on that later in the deck. And then we've included our scenario testing plan for next year, which involves testing both of the IVSs as well as cyber test and increasing the maturity of that testing by including some of Easel's IVSs, so testing across the entire business. I think with that, we can move into the deck. So, if we go to the Q4, Q1 plan, so you'll see on here that a number of the activities that I've just mentioned are complete ahead of the end of the year. So, mapping, assessment, our ratings approved, cyber test, and we have uplifted our MI against both IBSs. And that involves having a more like a better dashboard across both IBSs to be a bit to have a higher understanding of kind of what's going on across both of those and be able to call out any issues that we may see. 21: No, the one thing I would add is part of the MI that we've built out is looking to see where resilience factors are being used sort of in a day-to-day basis. When we had a meeting with KPMG, they said that was best practice. If you have resilience indicators that are being used relatively frequently, it can sort of supplement your testing schedule to kind of showcase that. 11: What do you mean by resilience? 21: So, when a transaction is authorised, Goes to a system called CAS, but there is the option for the network to stand in in place of CAS, and we can track how frequently that occurs for EAPS or merchants on a sort of day-to-day basis. Okay. 8: And then we've got a number of items that will run into next year. So our business service review is just being wrapped up and finalised and brought to the board in February for the services that are not imported and then we will re-review our importance and services at the start of next year as well. The special review will run through to March 2026 and we expect the final report in March so we will update on that in due course. We will be reviewing and refreshing all of the playbooks that were drafted this year and making sure those are up to date and the key personnel listed in them and the procedures are up to date and any training is rolled out as needed and then we've got our scenario testing plan in place for next year. Move on to the next slide. So this is just a kind of a timeline view of kind of where the key activities are expected to fall over next year, very similar to this year. So kicking off the year with kind of IVS and impact tolerance reviews and then playbooks refreshing over the first part of Q1 and then yeah you can see next slide this is coming up. So again the next couple of slides are just the view of our vulnerabilities across both IBSs. We've got a number of new items which are in the bright blue which have come out so Matt I don't know if you want to speak to a couple of those. 21: Yeah so the enhanced MI is essentially at the moment we have a reporting package available that my team is pulling together that is manual and only available on a monthly basis as it stands at the moment. What we're looking to do is automate that process so we have a sort of our BI dashboard that we can go in and that will refresh on a daily basis. We have some tech capacity, but my team are trying to see if we can deliver it ourselves so we'll be able to hopefully get it delivered prior to May. So, work with discussions with tech and the data strategy teams are ongoing there. And then the final one is enhance the mapping of the processes. So, at the special risk committee, we talked about how we'd added some granularity to the mapping, especially what we had going into this year. And the plan is that we take that sort of a bit further, looking at more of the architectural flows and the data flows, and that's what our plan is for the remainder of this year and internet. 8: I think next slide. So, I think the payments IBS is where most of the new vulnerabilities have been identified off the back of this incident. 7: So, yeah, it's actually off the back of our CSA. It was created for submit, settle, and reconcile, as well as like the anticipation of a special review. So, should I run through these quickly? So, the first one is: when we do have a payment incident or disruption, where we need to communicate to the merchant, and in order to support the rush comms process that Ellie and team have developed, we need to have very quick access to the SE information, merchant name, and so forth. That process can take days, and there's a tech dependency on that. So, that's been raised as an issue. So, tech support needed there. Partial file redirects: so, this is where if we have non-BAU rejected payments, this is where we want to be able to take a portion of the file and process the file rather than delaying, which is what happens today. The unclear intraday limits: this is the issue we've talked about before with JP Morgan. They have undisclosed, unadvised IDLs, intraday limits. And this is an issue that's been longstanding due for closure in March. So, this will be a combination of a solution with Treasury as well as splitting the multi-currency payment file. The lack on visibility movement of funds, this is really having visibility on the movement of Treasury funding. So, we know we have confirmation when Treasury has issued their instructions for funding, but we don't know when the funding has moved. And we have had a couple of near misses this summer where Treasury has bumped up against their intraday limit at their banks, causing a delay to funding for our merchants. So, we want to have visibility of those for early detection of any potential issues. And then the last one is around: this was opened in anticipation of the special review. So, if there are a spike in rejects or out-of-pattern rejects, we don't have any notification of that happening. We would like to have a more of a real-time notification of that so that we can create that intervention and move those payments along. 8: The other thing I would call out is we've raised a number of issues across our vulnerabilities, whether that's at programmatic level or with the IBSs, to control management in advance of the special review kicking up on the 16th. They have not accepted all of the issues to date. And so, we are in conversation of redrafting the wording of those issues, but we had pushback from them as to open them as issues which are pushed back from control management levels. Saying that it doesn't meet a criteria for an issue, so having to like reword it with the help actually Vidris from IAG has been helpful in helping us reword some of those to make sure that we do get micro self-identified, especially while we've tried to open the risk retaining as a risk as well. 22: I don't understand. So, they're saying the word is not correct. They can't be acquitted. Yeah, that pushes that. The definition of issues has changed as well. 11: I think it's probably not giving a bit. Releasing the right sense of it, although I don't see all the importance. 7: Question on the ones which are awaiting tech prioritisation. They all need tech prioritisation, actually. 22: So, where are we with that? Because, like, because when we were in New York a few weeks ago, Seth popped up as a thing saying that what was prioritised is whatever, and then said it's circulated afterwards, and you never did. I spoke to Antonio Julia, no one's seen the prioritisation. And my honest fanning is very little is being funded. Very little is being funded, is what I've heard. Yeah, there are mandates. But even with your mandates, they can't fund everything. 12: These are new though, Ali, right? So, to flag when they're in the second two of all of those. Not all of them, but the bottom, the TBCs. 22: The issue is that the top two are waiting tech prioritisation, but I don't I'm not clear whether they've been prioritised or not. You're not clear. 7: No. 22: But I think people are clear within the organisation because there is a list of what's not being funded. 7: Not for ops res. So I've had quite a few conversations on this because I've been talking to Kamal and I think I've even mentioned it at this board that he is of the firm belief that financial crimes and ops res need to be prioritised. Johnny and I were at a meeting yesterday with Judy who is saying that they will take the advice of control management but it is the business that decides that who is the business in that context? 22: Me? 19: I would say Dan, that the board's opinion will weigh heavily on prioritisation, obviously. But I think there's a reason the list hasn't been distributed. So we typically say is it above the line or is it below the line? Above the line means it's funded. It's going to go on the roadmap, but of course that could change in three year. Below the line means it's currently not funded. And I don't think the list is final. I don't think it's final for. For full distribution, no. So, what I can do, Dan, is given that you spoke to Seth when you're in New York, I'll drop him a note. 22: You flicked it up on the screen and then said it circulated, but then never did. 19: But not quick enough to take a screenshot, right? 22: I'll try it, I'll just wasn't quick enough. 7: But there is conversation because there are mixed views on parasitation obstructs. 22: But I think the challenge is very easy to make decisions on things looking on a piece of paper and getting Kamal's input. But there's a whole piece of context missing. Like where we are with Easel, where we are with EPSIL, how big a risk is it to the organisation? What interactions are we having with the regulator? What commitments have we got? None of that is context that Kamal, Judy, or anyone knows. So I don't understand how. 7: I think Kamal gets that. 22: He wouldn't know about any of what I was just outlining. 7: I mean, from an EAPSIL perspective, I've talked about it. But I think your point is taken. And I raised this actually with Judy yesterday because when there are local legal entity boards with colleagues with accountability, how is that being factored into the decision process? 22: Well, I'd also just remind you: I think the worst is the ones that board is men have mind the matter over management of the business. So if we say these are the things we need, decisions are taken elsewhere on what we need, then we need to be involved in those discussions. 7: So this is really enterprise payments that are coordinating this. So, I mean, I think, Johnny, that was kind of the nature of the discussion here. 19: Yeah, partly, I would say, partly because I think, I mean, we could either talk about it now or we could take it offline, but I would say more broadly, where these vulnerabilities sit are across multiple road and product roadmaps. Some of them, Christine, you're right, sit on enterprise payments. So, Judy's lending. Is how can we drive synergy? But the others on Seth's roadmap, they're outside of Judy's purview. 7: I think it's good to take offline, but I think this is a really important point to read. And exactly that, how does the local perspective factor into these broader is that process matched? 19: How that works? It's an art, not a science, Dan. But look, Christine's right. The feedback we heard yesterday was Ana, Kamal, and other senior leaders are discussing what's the right model for this because I think there's a belief that control management shouldn't be making the decision on what's above the line, below the line, but there's not a definitive answer on who that should be. I think what Christine's done. 22: Rob is responsible with the international business. Rob should be with our input making the decisions about trade-offs for international. 7: I want to hear what's in a good job of. What are you going to say? 19: I was going to say back to the point earlier. If I think about the business value statements we've put in on all of these roadmap items, we have lent heavily on the feedback from the board, on the regulatory expectation. Christine has constantly badgered Kamal in control management to say operational resilience is important in the UK, these need to be above the line. The problem is, as the process accelerates at the back end and goes to more of the senior leader discussions, we don't have the visibility on where we net out. 9: Well, can the Seth Department explain the prioritisation of what's been, what trade-offs have been made on Operation Resilience? 22: But he can't answer to us around trade-offs. He's not making a decision. 11: But whoever is. 22: It's not clear he's making the decisions to me. 11: No, but he's coordinating the dialect code, so. 19: He's cool. Let me take away and. Our feedback to Seth. 22: We haven't. We're not clear. There's people saying we haven't, and there's people saying we have. I agree. I think we need to get, but I don't think there is clarity. Susie, that's the problem. I think there's a process that's being worked through that we're not clear on to work out what's tech being technically prioritised and what's not. 8: What's the action? 22: I think the action is probably a few steps back. Actually, it's not about what's prioritised and what's not. It's how does the board input into the process to make sure that tech priorities for each tool are prioritised? That's the first action. That's a more strategic, I suppose, systemic issue. The second point is we need to know for next year what's prioritised and what's not. And as we sit on the end of this year, we don't, we're not clear on that. I know why we're not clear on it. I absolutely know why. And I get why we're not clear, but we need to know. 8: I'm not quite sure what that means in terms of action. 22: I think the action is, to Johnny's point, he should take a follow-up with Johnny to speak to Seth to work out when we're going to get clarity on the roadmap. But I think there is another action, which is the first thing, which is around I'm not clear. I don't think anyone around this room is clear how we interject into decisions about prioritisation for our tech is brought to us. We are not in those discussions. We're not inputting into them. Yes, Christine's inputting some stuff on control for control management for resilience. I'm not sure how Kamal then takes that. 3: To do with like fraud risk, who would be able to prioritise all fraud risk requirements? I think I need to take it away and talk to the board about it. 7: It seems like to your point on process, maybe there is a process step for the board to ratify what impacts the legal entity. 22: Well, I think we need to be involved in the decision-making, making clear what we want, what the risks are, and be involved in that decision-making process. I'm not sure we are at all. Yeah, I would say. Let me take that away as an action. I think there's probably three parts to it. There's the strategic how do we get involved in the decision-making that Dan's brought out. There's the what is the decision that is in fact made about prioritization, and then there's a third part which is the board after that prioritisation acknowledging and escalating the risks associated with that prioritisation and then we can manage it through those three approaches. Yeah, Bert agrees. Yeah, so I'll talk to Rob about decision-making around tech, who's involved, who's making the decisions. That's the wider thematic point. And then, to your point, if once decisions are made, how do we recommunicate the risk back? That's one conversation. And the second conversation, Johnny, is can you take that away to understand? I know why we're not clear, Johnny. Yeah, I'll connect with you afterwards, but we need some clarity. Okay, okay. 8: So, moving on. 1: Hey, Dan, we do for GCG, we do have a CES is doing that's a monthly update on all the tech investments. I wonder if it couldn't be possible to do the same for GCG in the GMS international, it does run. 19: It happens, it does. Yeah, every one of Anna's DRs, there is a readout of the investment process. So, he does one with Rob, Rob's DRs. I don't know when the next date is. 22: Dan, you didn't attend or I both have not been to that meeting at all. 1: Yeah, because I know there is one for GCG on a monthly basis about the review of all of the tech projects. 22: I don't know, maybe Rob has a review, I don't know. 1: Yeah, yeah, okay. 21: Okay, so final bit now is the legal assessment, which I know has come to the board in the last two iterations. Essentially, what this is looking at is where does Annex's responsibility from an operational resilience standpoint lie? Where we have different acquiring models and different kind of parties in the payments chain. Essentially, what this was trying to break out is where is Annex responsible versus where, where do we care, for want of a better phrase? Where would we need to report to the regulator if one of these parties went down versus not? And really, what the outcomes of this assessment was to define that, define where the IBSs started, where they ended, and also identify some areas for opportunities where we could potentially enhance existing process or existing kind of verbiage in contracts or operating regulations to kind of be a bit more firm on our operational resilience commitments. So, we brought this. It was a big assessment that required us to look in depth at each of those models, but also some of the ancillary products which go in concert with these models. So, things like electronic data capture, which is essentially a product where Annex will be doing the submission on behalf of a merchant. So, on the next slide, we've got a sort of very quick status update of how this stands. So, last time we came to present to yourselves, we brought the payment facilitation review insofar as Amex is not responsible from an operational resilience standpoint if a payment facilitator were to go down. We have now completed the talking from the accept a transaction standpoint. We've completed our assessment across all of these models now. And as of Friday, Friday just gone, we have also got the review and the assessment of all of these models done. So, from a legal assessment perspective for accepted transaction, we are complete. To give you a very, very quick run through, payment facilitation, we're not responsible for payback from an operational resilience standpoint. MLPS, we are responsible for those entities. They act as agents of American Expressive. So, you said we're not responsible, but it's got TIC. Oh, sorry, this is just the status from the status of the assessment. So, we need another column here, which is like responsibility. So, the MLPS, we are responsible. What my team is currently looking into is deep diving what are our kind of current oversight regime with MLPS partners, what do our contracts say to understand if we've got any gaps and also any opportunities? 22: We are responsible, we are responsible. Direct, hang on a second, that's interesting, right? Because we're responsible not only for the MRPS bit, but also down to the ISO because you're responsible for MRPS. You can't say you're responsible for any stuff that's dumped through Edivont directly, not through their ISOs. That's another arm's length away from that factor. 21: Yeah, when we look at someone like NanWest Til, we know that they outsource the processing elements, so the sending of authors, for example, to FISERV. 22: So, in that context, Fiserve becomes their team members, they outsource their whole custom management to someone else, to FinTech, which have a terrible problem here. So, are we responsible for that FinTech? 21: This is what we're trying to kind of currently work out. But for example, in my donor control, we're looking at where they're outsourcing, say, processing elements, what we can potentially do on our side, maybe to introduce some real-time monitoring. So, if there is a different performance, we can get some alerts of those. So we're kind of working through that now. Direct, when we think about processors, we are not responsible for a processor that a merchant may choose to appoint. So acting in the normal kind of fashion, so planet payments, for example. Payment designation, we're not responsible for the designate. And SafeKey was listed separately here because it applies across all acquiring models. And the 3DS server, which is essentially the third party that connects into SafeKey, we are not responsible for those either. So the outcome of this is MRPS is the only one where we need some additional deep dives to understand kind of how the other land is. But Christine, I don't know if you have anything. 7: We're similar. I mean, we can update on this. So payment facilitation, not responsible. Skip on MRPS. Direct, responsible. Payment designation, not responsible. So we have clarity on that. On MRPS, it's a similar question. We are responsible. But what we don't have a clear view on, and this has also been raised as an issue, which is in the process of being created, is how do we affect a payment to a merchant if the MRPS part goes down? How do we ensure that we have current bank data on the merchants to make that payment? So this is the state that we're at now in assessing. 22: Of course, that's an issue, isn't it? Because we don't have any bank data. We don't have any bank data. 7: We do. Apparently we do. Apparently we are provided with bank data when it's set up, merchant is set up. But what it would need to be something like refreshed bank data through OMAS, that's possible, so that we constantly have a current and then we need to verify those bank accounts, don't they? Yeah, because I checked with Chris, we don't actually do that bank account. 22: No, we don't because they're MRPS. 7: So do we need to introduce that? These are the questions that we're exploring. 22: Well, we don't like the MRPS model right now. We're going to end. I mean, we are exiting MRPS, right? By the end of sometime in 27, we believe. Problem is, all this stuff doesn't stop. And that's why we just take a step back. That's why we want just one model for small merchants. You want a payment designation and then have a few merchants. Sorry, I paid back and then have a tiny number of merchants direct, but you can see just the number of models, the complexity it brings to stuff like operational resilience. I don't think we've got any excuse we're going to have to do the work because we've still got to have the model into 27. 7: So we can outline what needs to get done, time frames to do that, and so forth, and then take the decision. Do we do it given the time? 12: And the MRPS timelines for offering our channels. 4: We've got that roadmap, yeah. 7: Maybe that's an action, right? 18: Sure. We can connect on that. 12: Christine, you said you're looking at this for Europe too, though, right? Because the MRPS, like an operational, this issue that's been identified. 7: Yeah. Yeah, so generally when we identify an issue for the UK, we're also applying it to the media. Yeah. 8: Sorry, this test plan. That's not it. So yeah, this is our testing plan for next year. So we've done, we've completed what we see for this year, which covers a whole range of basics. So we've completed the site test. We've got a transaction test plan that we want to say. So you can Yeah, one guys, three nights. Thank you. I think resource-wise, we're comfortable. I think the overall programme is running well, and we've made huge progress this year in terms of like mapping and the IBSs. I think where we still need to mature, and that just takes time. And it's not, I don't think throwing more resource at it would necessarily solve that maturity. Like, it just takes us time to have to work through that. When you say that, you mean each time we have an incident or a scenario learning? Yeah, I just think in terms of actually maturing the capacity of our scenario testing over time and maturing our programmatic MI. So I think the MI within the IBSs has like On a huge way, I think our programmatic MI across people-premises, data, technology, and needs to be in a better place for 2026. That's on plan. So, I'd say our two areas that we need to mature in sit with our programmatic MI, our testing, and then mapping. We're working on level three mapping into next year. And then, I think, overall, kind of what came into question itself, says when it was like the governance, right? And like things like we've talked about, like making sure that we get the tech investment where we need it because we do have a concern that you know we're a UK business, but we don't have control over all of the systems that our business operates on. 9: So, you think tech is the biggest risk to resilience program currently. 12: Tech prioritisation and oversight, oversight in general, I think, that we've seen. Like, we just don't, we're a huge matrixed global organisation. 22: Okay. Can we talk about this bank issue very quickly then? Who's leading this? Thank you, Beatrice. 8: Okay, so we can go to these as a summary. Okay, so there's a few areas on this. So, first one is there are a couple of board actions from the last meeting. The first was that was an update on the compliance call that took place. The full update is provided in the deck. But in summary, what was discussed is the city will formally tell us if you know if they have concerns, but they will not materially change their position. I don't think there were any sort of major concerns from a compliance format. And then the second was to assess the materiality. So, three cases have occurred since the onboarding of Citi. These are detailed on page three, and you can see that they're like bar Muslim hands, which was discussed at length. The three on the bottom right is quite immaterial in terms of the actual volumes of payments going through those. And I can update on where those specific cases are as well. 4: And they all came out very early in the transition, nothing since then. 8: I mean, we've had a number of cases that have been, city have requested more information on. We've only had three cases where we didn't already hold that information to provide to city. So we've had to go out to the merchant to request further information. And that satisfied city. And then we haven't got that information back from the merchant yet. 7: In one, it did not. In Muslim hands, it did not satisfy them, and they cancelled the payment. And then that was that incident over the summer. The other two, as Eli says, we've gone out to the merchant for information, they've not responded. Yeah. 8: So, yeah, and like on slides five and six, I can talk through what that process looks like. But the second piece we're going to talk to you about is PTU. So maybe if we go to the PTU slide, which you need a board decision on. Yes. Okay. 22: So I'm not clear. So we just go back. I'm not clear on this issue. So city asks for information, we give the information, they either made the payment or they don't make a payment. You're saying in one case they haven't made the payment, Ms. Hans, we know about. In the other cases, they have, we're still in discussion with them. 8: So we, in the other two cases, we have requested information from them. Actually, like maybe I'll cover this now. If we go to slide five, this will show what's currently happening. So there's no, basically, the current process that these merchants have fallen into is like not defined and not a very good process. So what happens is city requests the information and in 98% of the cases we have that information and we pass that back to city and that satisfies their requirement and we pay permission. In a very, very 22: Presumably, Joe, there's a in the city agreement, or in our agreement, we've got the permission from the merchants to provide that information to a third party. I haven't read the agreement, but it would be that would be a standard term if financial clubs reasons. I would suggest that we refer that one to GCO for a big check. We've even got, I don't even know if we cover this before. 7: That would be in the bank agreement or the merchant agreement. 8: In the merchant agreement, we do have, because we've just gone through this for the privacy stuff with KOC, if we have a legitimate interest. 22: Okay, right, fine. So we've got permissions to transfer it to City. 98% of the time that closes it out. 8: Yeah. So in the case where it doesn't close it out, City requests a specific documentation that they need. That then goes to servicing and servicing outreach to the merchant. But what they actually do is they outbound call the merchant three times. And if they don't get through to the merchant, they then send a call to action to the merchant. So they send them an email saying, please call us. But so far, if the merchant hasn't picked up the phone, the merchant doesn't know why they need to call us or what they need to provide. At no point have they said we need this specific passport document because they're just doing outbound call. And at the same time that it goes to servicing, it gets an FYI to MCO and sanctions to check that we don't have any sanctions concerns. And so we're left with a merchant that is probably not going to call in. They've received a call to action. We can't cancel them because we haven't notified them that we're going to cancel them. We haven't sent them any cancellation messaging to say we can't paid them. And we haven't paid them and we can't pay them. 11: So that's even though the logic is not calling, if I were to know one call and hopefully. 22: So it's just three calls to a merchant. No, no, they're not worth receiving the agreement. Yeah, but you want notice you haven't received the payment. 8: And they're like £74. Like it's not. Notice that so of these two cases, one basically what I've done proposed a new process on slide six, which I have in mind with GFCC and Hatch out Joe as well. So what we're proposing to do is where the city has specific request documentation we don't have on file, instead of passing this servicing process for outline calling, we pass it to the sanctions process which already exists within compliance. So MCO, pass that then through to servicing and that comes with a bespoke outreach. So that email, an email will go to the merch saying, hey, we need a passport copy of this director and it includes if we don't receive this, we will may have to cancel your merchant account. 3: But if you put that detail in the email there, so we want you to send us a passport. I think they're even less likely to receive a passport. I think you've got a trust. It just seems like it's phishing. I think getting them to call us is the best approach. I don't think putting in more information in the email will make it a little more authentic. 8: We have to send some sort of cancellation comp because we can't, we're in a situation otherwise in the initial process where we have we can't do anything. We can't fulfil our contract of paper version and we can't cancel them without writing a bespoke cancellation letter to them and giving them 60 days notice. So we can't fulfill our contract essentially. 22: Because not because of anything we've done, it's because of city. 6: Correct. 22: So why wouldn't we phishing? We're satisfied. That's the problem of contraction in here. We've got no issue. It's our vendor who's got an issue. 9: Yes, and that trumps our issue. That's still our issue. 22: But it's our issue because it's our vendor that's impacting our customer. 12: But there are data gaps with these two examples, right? Where city wants something over and above what we don't have. 9: From our KYC property system. Can we not buy the data? Because you know, we were talking about earlier that KBMG struggling to even get the KYC data out of our system. Is that a reason for some of this? 8: It may be that the merchants have been refreshed in five years and we haven't got a new director's passport that City required. It could be like it could be something that's in the backlog, it could be a number of issues, or it could be something that we don't even request because they've gone through simplified due diligence that City want enhanced. 4: I recall that one of these was for us to get comfort that the owner of the barbers, and I might be speaking out of turn here, wasn't an ex-Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander or something because there was a match of names. So I think one of it, one of this was just for extra reassurance rather than you didn't have anything. So we said, well, let's just do a check ID to get the ID sent in, and that must be one that's mostly ID, I believe, that's required. 22: Both of them are right. It's a slight difference in risk appetite between, in some cases, between us and City. And it's a case in which we have a more conservative approach in some cases. But what that means is, de facto, for those cases, our risk appetite is being set by the vendor. 8: And then we've got. 22: And then we're just hanging on. And then we're disrupting our customers, holding their money because of our vendors' risk appetite. And if I knew, it should be clear. If I knew all about this, I'd never, we'd never agreed this two of money. I never even thought this would be a problem. I'd never have moved this to City. I'd have kept it. I know the bottom isn't more expensive. There's three merchandise. We never had this issue. 7: Barclays had other issues. There were ABS-RES issues with Barclays. But we're talking about two merchants. We have made hundreds of thousands of checks. We're talking about two. 8: And one of them is council-duced KYC. So we're talking about one. It's a current issue right now. 19: Okay, but also, Dan, this happens in other markets outside of merchant payments as well, almost on a daily basis, you know, and the bank's tolerance level. Also, regularly change, so what's the proposal there? 8: The proposal is we loop them into this process so they get a bespoke outreach telling them what they actually need to provide. 22: Which I think is those valid concerns, people are going to think that's phishing. 8: Yeah, but then there's also concerns of them not responding to a call to action. 12: Merchants always think we're phishing, like our large merchants are phishing sometimes when we're feeling marketing. 11: I just don't do this, you'll have to do a do that as well. 8: So we can do outbound plus this, and we've got two options here: the merchant responds, provides the information, and it satisfies City, great. Or the merchant doesn't respond to us, in which case we have now told them we are allowed to cancel them. And at this point, I think we're going to have to cancel them. 22: I don't think we should cancel merchants because City decide they don't like them. There's no other option. Sit and wait for them to call us and reach out to them again. 7: But Ellie, there is the option of. So we can make a PTU payment, the urgent payment. Right. The urgent payment. So we can push a payment through JP Morgan. Right. So we've set up that process. So that was a gap that existed over the summer with Muslim hands because we didn't have that process with JP Morgan. We've now established it. So we could push the payment through JP Morgan. If JP Morgan allows the payment to go through, they don't have the same concerns. We can then set the merchant up on multi-currency. And then that can become their BAM platform. If they allow it. 8: If they allow it. But if we can't contact them. In this case, where they have a contact, if we then can't contact them to set them up with multi-currency. No, you have to have merchant engagement. 22: Or you just wait. 8: Yeah, you just hold them on the bank. 22: Wait, hold it as a debit balance until they ring. Keep writing to them. Keep writing to exist. Ellie, I'm not cancelling, to be really clear, I'm not cancelling merchants because city decide they don't like them. 8: No, no, I agree. But I don't mean you can just hold their money. 22: We can write to them. We've hold lots of merchants' money. We continue to write. To them, yes, at some point you have to make a decision, but we can but you've still got their money, so if they're holding onto their money, if it's financial crimes reasons, it was we looked at this. I think the challenge for this one, and the reason that makes it difficult is that precisely to your point, Dan, it's not our financial crime reason. No, it's someone else's, but so we wouldn't be holding it for financial crime reasons, we would just be holding it because we can't do anything else with it. 7: Yeah, but we're but at that point, we're not holding it because the citibank we're holding it because the merchant hasn't responded. We do have the option to go to JP Morgan, but at any point in that. 22: I think the idea of holding it to get them to respond is challenging because we're not holding it for financial crime, so we don't actually have safeguarding provisions. 9: I think it would have to be safeguarded if we don't have that. 22: No, we don't. But we also can't pay it to them either. So we can do this. 8: And we have, in both these cases, we have done the one off. 22: But do we need the merchant to participate in the JP Morgan payment? 7: No, not the PTU, not the urgent payment. But if then we want to move them onto multi-currency, then we do need their engagement. 12: They need to set it up, like the merchant ID system and with their PSP. 8: Because we've had the issue if they don't respond and say they don't want to be selling the multi-currency but continue to transact, we can't continue to make these. 15: Well, we can't continue to hold their money either. But you can block the terminal and stop. 8: But then that's essentially cancelling. Yeah. 22: So I think it comes down to like our we're not cancelling merchants because city does we're making we need to make our own decisions independently of city and our own policies and procedures. 15: If our payments partner raises a concern that we think has validity and we decide to that's different get additional that's different then 11: It might be that this is a city's concern. It's just that if you haven't refreshed it in five years, then maybe this becomes our concern as well, if we would do it again. 22: So there is a financial crime treason there. If the merchant doesn't bring it up, there's a lot of pips in that. But if that were the case, then we could make an argument as a financial crime reason. But that's not going to be the case at every time. There's a lot of solution-orientated people in this room, which is why we're getting into a solution discussion. I think this needs to be taken. I think it needs to be take this away and bring it back. I think we need to work out a way with bringing this together to say it is a financial crime treason and we're holding the money until the merchant responds to us for financial crimes reasons because another entity has raised an issue. 12: We have to investigate it. 22: Which we need to investigate, and to Susie's point, therefore we're holding the money for financial crimes reasons. I think we can look at that. The government will say there is a possibility we won't be able to do that. So it may come back here with the same recommendation again in January. But we're happy, you know, I'm very happy to take that away with the team. But I think we need to be on notice before we'll take it away and bring it back. I think separately, is there an opportunity to have a discussion with City? I mean, Muslim Hat has been a bit more difficult. I've had several calls with them. 7: But again, I think it's the magnitude. 22: My worry here is not three merchants, right? Because three merchants aren't going to live without. I don't worry about that. I mean, you heard we're cancelling millions of DPV. My worry is Misnerhat's had some seriously influential people involved in it. It could have caused us a massive problem. And my worry is there's no visibility, no one's checking this stuff, and the merchants, you could cancel something really significant that could cause a real issue for us. 7: These get caught. I mean, these are rejected payments. Well, they're not rejected, they're health. They get caught. But we haven't gone on to the next part of the conversation, which is that. So, my takeaway from the lie. Go up to the PCA slide. 22: Yeah. 7: Yeah, this one. So we had said when we were walking through the sequence at the last meeting, so let's jump down to status. So PTU is that urgent payment, that out-of-BAU payment method. Citibank says for whatever reason they're uncomfortable, we go to JPMorgan, we can push the payment through JPMorgan. The question becomes: if JP Morgan says, I don't want to pay this merchant. 22: HSBC. 7: We can go to HSBC. So we went and did the due diligence on that. That is at a cost of $25,000 per year to hold that option with HSBC to make that payment. It would take us three to four months to set it up because we have to go through their EDD and KYC due diligence. But we can do it. So to have that optionality, so you've now had two banks reject the payment on the basis of KYC concerns or financial crimes concerns. Do you want to have that option for a third person? 22: Well, I think we should wait and see if we get more cases over the next couple of, over the next quarter. Okay. Because it feels like ridiculous to spend $25,000 for one merchant. Could be my view. 11: Also, it's not an ongoing solution. But also, if two banks have rejected, do we really have a basis to win the third one? 7: Well, that was the discussion at the last meeting, and we thought maybe yes. But it's not a BAU option. It's just a one-off payment. 22: The problem is, Satchi, you have to think of a world where, you know, American banks, which two of them are on that page, and we are an American bank, might take different positions to us on certain customers. And we might be okay with those customers, but City and JP Morgan might not be. What would you do? What would you do then? 8: Somebody decided to go with HSBC as a third option. 22: Exactly. So we do need to. They could have a different. I suppose what we talked about last time was we thought City and JP Morgan were quite similar in their risk area. 8: If you have one of them and HSBC, I agree. But because you've got two that are really similar, I feel okay about if they're different because I feel like they agree. 12: But how do we know they're making similar? You're just assuming that because they're both global organisations. 3: But like in the case of the US Bank and an international bank, then like you've got like in the case of Muslim hands, they were paid because JP Morgan are fine with them. 12: Yeah, so we switched them. And JP Morgan will be fine with these two as well. 22: So the question is: do you need HSBC or not? That's what Christine is. So, Christine, our options are: one, you could say definitely need KPMG and put it in place, HSBC we put it in place now. Another option might be to we've got the plan bill to wait, see if this problem presents itself again. And if we can't solve it through Citibank, JP Morgan, we would, and we saw multiple cases, we could put the plan into action with HSBC, couldn't we? 7: With three to four months' need time, yes. 22: We've not had any cases yet, to be fair, have we? But JP Knight wouldn't pay. 7: Well, we haven't paid these other two. Although you said one of them was cancelled? 8: No, one of them was cancelled, but I did confirm to Johnny to go ahead. Okay, I checked with him today. Okay, fine. 22: But it's a systemic, it's a systemic weakness in our, which is a systemic gap in our operating, right? Like, if Citibank and JP Morgan decide they didn't like a swathe of merchants, we'd be really struck. What have we done in the scale of problems or challenges we have? Look, Keith, these things are never a problem to it, he's a massive project. And in my experience, nothing's a problem, and then it goes from being nothing to a big problem. I mean, what have we done in other models? That's a good question. 12: We haven't had this problem. We've never had a merchant that we haven't been able to do. We also pay for risk reasons. 22: But we also don't have the scale of business, think about it here. France and then I think it's going to be France and Germany would be doing the UK. I mean, look, if you're really being really prudent, you'd say put the process in place for HSBC now. You take four months to do the work, because 25 grand, you know, we make over a million, 1.5 million a day on the merchant business, so it's nothing. 7: We can do it and say after a year, do we want to keep it? 22: The problem is you'll face this situation and then you won't be able to deploy your option quickly. 6: It doesn't solve the problem, does it? 7: It just allows you to make that one off payment. Make that one payment and then the merchant relationship would need to be cancelled because there's no other BAU method to pay the picture. So that's the go-to. I mean, because there was another decision to say, what is the materiality of citibanks, sort of concerns, rejections, and do we need a dual bank? 22: So we need to move on. So the options are stick with what we've got. We've got the process map. We can deploy our plan with four months' time, obviously, if more cases come up, or we can hold or sorry, we can deploy the plan. So option one is stick where we are, see what happens. We've got a plan. If we need it, we'll take four months to deploy. Option two is deploy this, cover off a problem that might or might not ever happen. What do people want to do? What's your recommendation, Christine? 7: I would do it, trial it for a year and re-evaluate the need with HSBC. 16: Do you re-evaluate the need for three? Because is there a world where we have one American bank? 7: It's a nice idea. 22: But you don't JD Corbin do MCCYs. 7: Yeah. The only reason to go through them is that you could stop there and then move them onto multi-currency. 22: Good easily. 19: Good easily use. I'm sorry, easily Lloyds. And there's another option, right? So we've got an RFP open for the easel business at the moment to look at the UK bank partnerships. So I would say option three is HSB. SPC slash another provider, Christine, because I think that cost is ludicrous. Right. So Christine's recommendation, if you have an option, I'm going to take your recommendation, but I'm also going to take Johnny's option three. 22: The cost is too much, combine it with ease or business or anything, okay? 7: So do you have a time frame though, like by when we could like when are you going to close conclude that RFP and we could move forward? 19: So Jan, we will finish the scoring and make a recommendation. So Johnny, let's get this into that RFP. 22: Okay? Is that okay? Johnny, did you hear the PM? Yeah. Yeah, I said good. Right, let's move on. Thanks. 7: Thank you. 22: Good debate. Boy and Bush, we're running a little bit late. So we've got partner oversight, Keith. 4: It's me already. Right, so you'll remember last board we presented the very first dashboard. This pulls together a number of different reports that look at oversight for PayFac partners. So this is the second turn of the handle that was in the main deck. It's worth saying that since we pulled the over the report together, something called ADR has come along, which is accelerated data remediation. And that's really been the priority from an oversight point of view with our partners. What ADR seeks to do is to address two areas. One is data quality. So where we don't have complete seller information or authorized signer information, we've gone to the partner to say we need it by the end of January, otherwise we're going to cancel these merchants down. 15: So there's lots of dialogue with sponsored merchants. 4: Sponsored merchants will cancel the sponsored merchants down. So there's dialogue going on between my team and the partners to make sure that whatever tech work needs to be done to get with those data prices. The second part of accelerated data remediation is something called RG0s, which essentially is where we process a transaction without knowing who that seller is. It can happen right now, technically, believe it or not. That's obviously an area of risk for us that we will close out through this ADR process. So, although the dashboard has a number of different metrics in it, the one that we're really, really focused on is addressing data quality right now. 15: I'm probably, yes. 11: Why is the stylus red? 15: Why do you use it because you need to be faster finishing the it's because there's certain partners, there's certain merchants for whom we don't get the seller data and all the authors in the data when you finish the accelerated data remediation. 22: So, when we finish, there's there's an enforcement part of will it be green when you finish there, Keith, on data quality, because you put red in front of us on data quality. Yes, we're doing ADR. When does ADR finish? End of February. There's two parts to ADR. There's two phases: there's end of Jan and end of March. 15: At the end of March, we've done all the remediation and housekeeping, so if we've got gaps, we're going to cancell. 22: So, at that moment in time, we're good. So, by the end of Q2? Yeah, simultaneously, we'll prevent any reoccurrences happening because we'll block the transaction. So, by the end of Q1, data quality number four will be green. Yeah. 9: Okay. 22: And that's. 15: Because of the gap, because the quality is bad. I mean, red is in the notes, you can see that we've identified red as the tech. 22: Exactly. So that's the criteria we've used to give the red label. You can't, basically, what you're saying is you can't have a red label in Q2 because the transactions just won't be allowed to take place. Yeah. Okay, fine. Yeah. On the not knowing who the sellers are, do we know if the PayFactor us have a sanctions view of that at all? Well, the partners will be doing. 15: Sanction screening, but we choose not to rely on that for business. 22: Yeah, um, we do our own screen. So we won't be doing it here if we don't have all the data. Yeah, so we are not doing sanction screening on some of these sponsored merchants. So when we get the data back in, we may need to do another push of all of that data through that house anyway. So that will happen earlier. Yeah, from GSMF feeding into Bridger. So in Q1, end of Q1 will be green on data quality. Yeah. Because we won't allow the transactions if you don't have data. If we have gaps, it will be declined, which presents other questions, but yeah, for the purpose of data quality, it will solve. 12: And there should be no chance of that data moving. It's definitely happening. 22: Yeah, there's no indication. It's prioritised or so. And then your other red, Keith, exemptions and non-compliance. So the MRPS exceptions are for Elevon, which we talked about. So for global payments, which we talked about earlier, aren't they? There's Dojo in there, there's Global Payments. So can you talk about the plan, the path to green for number six? 15: Well, as exceptions come up for, as they expire, they'll be declined. 22: So the number of exceptions will reduce and therefore it will come back within Dojo. Keith on Dojo, for example, we're cancelling the MRPS agreement in January, so their exceptions will be eradicated. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Dojo were shutting down the MRPS payments. How many of the seven are there? Did you know? 15: We've counted it as a partner level, so they would be one of the seven. Okay, so that goes down by one. Yeah. And there are other non-AML and KYC related exceptions to do with things like when the last AML refresh was done by the partner, which has been deemed to be a lower priority, but they're not red-hot, if you will, KYC gaps. 22: So the exceptions will reduce. So you've got. Path to yellow on exceptions and no one compliance, but what green is, I can't read the thing, green is three. We've said zero to three partners across everything on compliance across all of our partners. So we've got a path to Amber. Yeah, all of these metrics will move in the right direction, but we'll focus pretty much primarily on number four at the moment. Okay, good. Any questions for anyone? Ellie, let's quickly do climate. 8: Perfect. So, yeah, quick update on climate. Essentially, preparation has begun for the disclosures. The first draft has been circulated for the disclosures. It's run across EASOL and the EAPSOL. So we are inputting to those disclosures and are part of reviewing them. It's considered a low regulatory risk to the legal entity, and that's why it's been changed within our management as well. So if you go to the next two slides, essentially, just walk through what the current disclosure looks like. The UK sustainability work group, which Shatshi sits on, has a board member and Sarah and my team joins. Oversee the disclosure, it's prepared by ICS with our input, and then it goes through a number of risk committees and the board, and that will be the case for EAPSOL as well. 11: Next one, just from a disclosure point of view, and here you're in those videos as well. It's very, very heavily guided by the corporate sustainability group. So a lot of direction and a lot of content comes from what has already been disclosed at the corporate level. 8: I think that kind of materially covers it. This just gives a quick view of the timelines of the first review is taking place now. We've received the Slide yesterday, I think. 22: Who's writing this EY? 8: No, it's being drafted internally and I've got to be EY. 22: Okay, fine. And so actually, are you confident you've got enough stuff to say in this proposal to meet our requirements? 11: I'm actually reading it. I'm not talking a word, it's long documents to be reading to it. But like I was saying, the content is very heavily exp central. It's very little pocketbook. But once I've had a look, I could circulate the comments. 10: I think it's also become less of that. 22: For who? 6: Everyone, people have the focus that they want. 22: It's not got the same level of focus in the US, has it? And certainly in Westminster, there's less focus on this. So I think from when I came in, it would certainly be privacy. I would say there's less focus on it. I mean, obviously do it. Obviously, it's always do it. It's not such a risk. Yeah, but what have we done? 6: I don't know if you know the answer to this. To the feedback we got from TLPC last year was that we need to try and make it more concise, streamline, better. 22: And also have more UK-specific stuff in it. That was it. But to Susie's point, I think the environment has changed since then. 6: So the feedback two years ago was they got more UK-specific examples, which we did to some extent. And as you say, there's less focus. The conciseness point, they've got stereotypes. 11: Yeah, and the team that's documented us has acknowledged it and would be able to do good feedback as a blog, but it has been they have tried to. Yes. 22: Okay, good. Thanks. Right, CG. 16: It's just thank you. 22: Good work, Ellie. Hey, Natalie. Speaker 2: Hi there. Hi, everyone. 22: How are you? 2: Well, thank you. How are you? 22: Good, good, good. You have our undivided attention. 2: Excellent. Good. So I'm going to talk to you. I'm not really sure who's around the table, but hopefully you can see me and you can see the deck. Just wanted to cover a few data points with you, including attrition, metrics. I have a slide that gives a snapshot of the Epsil population as well. We can talk about CLR cases. I've got a number of slides on GRL completion dates, and finally, I will talk you through the CS cut for Epsil. And where I thought there were notable differences, what I've tried to do is look at the comparison with EASOL as well, just to give you kind of another data point to think about. Hopefully, that's what you were expecting to see today. What I'm hoping we might be able to spend a couple of minutes on, Dan, as well, is kind of looking into next year, understanding whether there's any other information that you'd like to see on a regular basis too. 22: That all sounds great, Nathanie. So, in terms of who's around the table, you've got the EAPSOL board, so you should know most people. I know we're probably a small scheme because you're a check jetter, so I just go around and say, why don't you just introduce yourselves versus when you speak? 9: She can see you. 22: Okay, fine. Why don't you speak? 9: Hello, Susan. Hello. 12: Hi, Colleen Coffee. 4: Hey, Nathalie, Keith McDonald. 12: Hi, Natalie. It's Sarah Sharmstein. 4: Hi, Nathalie Colin Allen. Joe Usher. 12: Julia Hewson. 2: Shadgi. Hi, Hui. Yovy. Brinda. Excellent. Yeah, so I know everyone. All right, so I'm not sure. Gorinda, are you driving the slides? Oh, brilliant. So, Lara, if we can move to the next one, please. Thank you so much. So, this is a snapshot of the Epsil population as of the end of September of this year. And I'm just going to say up front as well: because of the date on which we had to submit the slides, we've got some information that is a few weeks old. So, thinking about GRL training in particular, is that information as at the end of October? So, if you'd like to see an updated version of those before the end of the year, just let me know as well. So, I don't know if you've seen this slide before or a version of this slide before. There's nothing particularly surprising or unusual about the makeup of the Epsil population relative to the UK overall or to other or to EASOL in particular. The population is relatively stable as well, so we've not seen any large fluctuations. And we've got like the majority of the population is band 35 and band 30 combination, which you would expect given the LOB split in the legal entity. The lower end of the tenure, again, this is relatively consistent with what we're seeing in the UK and with EASOL as well. So, nothing of particular note on this slide. Attrition, stable, definitely fewer ups and downs. We've seen in previous years, and it's a little bit down relative to the same period last year. It's also down, so it's lower than EASOL, which is currently at about 5.7%. 9: Actually, yeah. USCS US card services. 2: Yes. 8: Why is that sitting in Epsilon? 2: I don't know, don't know. 22: We have people clearly that are mislinked to mislinked, don't we? 2: Would you expect them to be somewhere other than they shouldn't be in EPSOL, should they? 8: They should be in definitely not their card services. Well, not the US. I'm not their card services. I live into IC. 22: It comes back to what Julia did a few years ago. He did that mapping exercise and he found there was a huge number of people. I mean, it was helpful from an EPSOL perspective, but there's a huge, from a management perspective, a huge number of people that were just. I mean, there was a lady, I remember Natalie in HR, a band 35 that had been in the GMS cost centre for like two and a half years, they came back and said, because people just hadn't moved the cost centers around. So I think there's a takeaway action for me to get my MA to have a relook with finance through who's actually on the EPSOL cost centres because there's 15 people by the look of it. If it's 3% of EPSOs, we need to understand that. It's an RPXA there. It's true that you're right. 2: Dan, if you want to ask your MA to reach out either to me or George, we can look at lists of headcounts and go from there. Okay. One on sorry. Laura, on just a small point on attrition, whilst attrition is low and that's overall a good thing, we probably also don't want attrition to be too low because that can then generate potentially issues in terms of people having development opportunities and kind of opportunity to grow their career. So it's not, you know, it's not a watch out, there's nothing concerning about those figures, but very low attrition. I think near enough 5% is healthy. If it was much, much lower, I would be a little bit more concerned. What is it externally, Natalie? Do you have sort of benchmark that you think about? No, so it's really tricky. So funnily enough, we had the same question at the Easel Board. Companies don't tend to share their attrition openly. So I think, given the makeup of the population, this is probably not unusually low, but it's really hard to get external data. 8: I had a mine on 20% for some reason, so that's right. 22: Yeah, at previous employers, it's been between 10 and 15% of similar size to here. 2: For similar roles as well? 22: Well, similar size organisation, nature of role obviously varies and depends on the organisation. 2: Yeah. Okay, thank you. So if we move on to the next slide, so this summarizes our CLR volume. So what's quite interesting with the volume by category is that unlike Other lines, other illegal entities or UK market overall, what's driving a lot of volume into CLR is non-CLR issues, meaning that people don't really know where to go with their queries, so they go to CLR as the default. By non-CLR issue, it may be benefit questions, payroll questions, those sorts of things that should either be directed to another team or should be directed to colleagues servicing. So there's definitely an education opportunity there in terms of helping people understand where to go for help because that's driving like a fairly significant amount of volume. Besides that, overall volume for Ipsol is on par with the headcount numbers. So 10% of the population for 9% of the volume. So that's good. That's how we would want it to be. Other notable considerations on this slide is the uptick in code of conduct investigations that we've seen this year. So 18 for the period to the end of October 25 versus 12 for the same period the previous year. This is not a happy trend. So it ties back to conversations some of us have had with the CET, the SMT, the same conversation with EASOL as well, that we do need to continue to educate leaders on how to nip things in the bud. There's some additional training on some of the serious code of conduct breaches around harassment, for example, that we'll really need to focus on next year. 22: So Natalie, these 18 codes. It's obviously a rather large increase year on year for each. So, are they can you just without obviously going into specifics? You know, one of the things that would concern the board, well, obviously multiple things, but you know, business conduct, i.e., you know, misselling to merchants. I don't think any of these 18 cases are related to misselling to merchants. 2: No, I don't believe so. So, I don't have the breakdown in front of me, Dan, but I don't believe there are either, although I can just go back and confirm that. There will be interpersonal issues, there will be conflict of interest type breaches as opposed to misselling. 22: So, there's no external, I suppose I'm just trying to dimensionalise this for the board, there's no external threat from having 18 cases. We haven't got people misselling to merchants. I think if you could just come back maybe to me, that's a great, that would be helpful because I can just confirm that back to the board. Most of these cases, I think I know a couple of them, relate to more where people interpersonal harassment, whatever you want to call it, issues, and then also people just not doing things that they were meant to do and really like, really not doing them, like not doing checks on merchants that they know they want it, they should have done, but just can't call us. I think that's what most of these cases relate to. 2: Yeah, and there's no particular trend in terms of a specific issue that keeps recurring or an issue that impacts a specific team. So, it's all kind of disparate cases. 22: And are these 18 cases? Did the 18 colleagues left the company? 2: Let me confirm that. I don't believe so. Yeah, I think there's some warnings in that. 22: I'll come back to that. That'd be helpful. 2: Yeah. 22: Okay, anything else on CLR? 2: We're seeing a rise in medical cases as well. Again, that goes a little bit against what we're seeing in other parts of the business. So it's just something to keep an eye on. This tends to be connected to longer term, more complex cases as opposed to short-term absences. 22: I mean, absence is hard to track, isn't it? Because people in knowledge jobs work an hour, they mark an hour and then sit in bed and be ill and then another hour later in the day they don't mark themselves an absence. And I'd rather they did that than to the whole day off. Obviously, as long as they're well enough to do that hour in the morning, an hour in the afternoon, it's a hard thing to track. But my observation is we pushed our people harder this year than I think any other year I've been in the company. And, you know, you need to watch things like absenteeism rate, sicknesses rate, because they can track up when you push people more. We've pushed them more as in we've asked them to do more than ever before with less. And we heard that very loud and clear through the CES. 2: Yeah, so you'll see that in the CES as well, the kind of that feeling overwhelmed comes through quite clearly in the comments in the CES. 22: And that's not a guardian thing, right? Because none of these people have done anything related to Guardian whatsoever. People say, oh, it's a guardian. It's nothing to do with that. They've been involved in bank remediation, Nitro, KYC. They've been involved in all local regulatory stuff at the same time as not filling roles and having to take on work. Okay. 2: And in terms of focus areas, what we've got here for Ipsol is no different to what we've got for the rest of the business. So it's looking At how we can strengthen our absence management process to reduce absenteeism, provide greater support to leaders in managing long-term ill health and continuing to focus on conduct risk through refresh policies, easier to follow processes and ongoing education. 22: The other thing that's not on here, Natalie, is obviously this week going into Parliament through Parliament is the new workers' rights bill, which I'm sure many of you have seen in anticipating some wide-sweeping change rights for colleagues on unfair dismissal right through to trade unions. So we're going to have to, we've had discussed it as a CT, we'll have to see how that plays out and obviously change our policies how we operate accordingly. 2: Yeah, one of the discussions we're having. 22: Sorry. So Holly was thinking of saying she might join it. She's joking. I might run. Maybe she wasn't. She's thinking she might be the trade union leader. 12: We want to be able to tell that on straight down. 22: Sorry? 12: We want to be able to tell you. 22: I might go on strike with you. 3: Right, let's move on. What CSC, Natalie? That second last bullet point on the right talks about upskill CSC. 2: Colleague Service Centre. 3: Okay. 2: So that's the light. That's the. 22: Can we talk about training, Natalie? I think that's an important thing to them probably need to think about finishing up. 2: Yes. So GRL, again with the caveat that this is 31st of October, data, we were at 94% completion. I've asked for 30th of November data, but I haven't had it yet. I think this is a healthy completion. Rate given the time, the timing, and you'll see that we're at very high 90s, 100% on the tier one, a lot of the tier one training. 22: But looking at this training, right, I'm on page 108, that something's not right in our hierarchy. No one should be doing US fair labour standards training in Epsil. 2: But if you've got USCS at the moment sitting in Epsil, that may be a lot of people. Exactly, that's the problem. That doesn't sound right for Peggy, yeah. 6: On the face of it, nothing later, yeah. 2: So we all ended up at the E sign. My whole team ended up at the E side. 22: Okay, alright. 2: There might be some graph issues as well, because, like, if you look at the numbers in the 40s, that's bigger than the USCS headcount, right? 3: So the ops team's in there as well. 22: Yeah. Well, you work for EAPSOL, right? 3: I think you did. 22: Yes. Your team would do. 3: The ops team, well, yeah. They would be listed as consumer services. 22: No, but they might be. So, Natalie, can you just come back to me directly as an action with the latest training once the deadline is now popped? I just want to just. 2: So we've got some due in December and some in January. Question about vulnerable customers as well. 3: Yeah, we noted earlier the vulnerability vulnerable customers is 46%, Natalie, whether that's a timing issue or if it genuinely reflects non-completion of really important training. 2: Yeah, let me just follow up on that. I'll follow up on this whole slide. 22: Yeah, and just if you should just keep me like send me an end of the year training, just because I think it's important board sees or I can just go through it for the board of just the training has all been completed because obviously that's a critical part of our control program. 12: Yeah. 22: No problem. Okay, good. And then CS, do you want to quickly finish up on that, Nathalie? 2: Yeah, sure. So CES, relatively stable year over year, I would say, with some notable exceptions, including my leader and my teamwork, which are you know like a bit of a downward trend. And also for what we're seeing is some differences between Ipsol sentiment and the rest of the organisation. So just to just in your interest of time to jump a couple of slides forward, Laura, I can't remember which slide it's on. Next one, that's it. So the least favourable questions, if you look at some of the differences between Ipsol and the UK overall, it's just something to kind of keep an eye on for sure. They are, you know, quite a bit lower than the UK. They're certainly the first three here. So making timely decision, effectiveness of processes and the technology, tools and system to do my job effectively. They are, so this is relative to the UK overall. I've also compared against Easel and the least favourable questions are the same, but they are less favourable in Ipsil than they are in Easel. 22: I hope that's helpful for us to know. 2: Yeah. If we look at the trend slide, which I think is the next one, that's it. So again, technology tools, it's going down. Good to see that people feel positive about the development opportunities that are available to them, and that's quite a bit higher than the UK overall. So this is kind of one of the areas where Epsil is definitely more positive. Still, opportunities in terms of leader conversations in relation to career and development and feedback. So the first two questions here, constructive career and development discussions with my leader, that's like heading in the wrong direction. And so is my leader seeking feedback from me. 22: Has anyone got any questions on this? Natalie, just to can you just finish up on the comment thematics? I think we've all read this. I just had a couple of questions. On improvement areas, workload. I was intrigued that Guardian got called out as a workload issue because if you think about the group of people that's impacted, it's a very small number. I think maybe it's not Guardian. I think it's maybe regulatory work. Do you know why? 2: I'll have to check down because I can't remember the, but I think the comments did specifically call out Guardian. Yeah, I think so. But let me just double check again and I'll let you know. 22: Maybe people are just regulatory stuff. Yeah, exactly. I think it's a banana, maybe then. 11: It's not the same of the Guardian project. 22: There are no Guardian projects. 11: No, but there is also this whole ORI stuff which is tied to Guardian, which is shorthand control and compliance. But it's elemental. 22: It's fine. Okay, alright. Yeah, I think Guardian is probably a proxy to compliance regulation and risk generally. Okay, any other questions for Natalie? So I think there's just the follow-ups on training, Natalie, and then the follow-ups cases to just come back to me on both, if that's okay. 2: Yeah, of course. Let me know, we don't have to sort this out right now, but let me know as well whether there's any other data points that you'd like to see. 22: Good update, thanks, Nathalie. I think the third thing is a lot I'm going to do with Natalie on who's actually the GMNS heading. 8: In terms of CES, do you maybe there's actual facts that are management? There are. 22: I mean, there certainly are within IT and SART. 11: I think there seems to be some specific teams, which probably aren't important at the CT level. 22: We have discussed it at CT level. Yes. Are we going to solve them? The good news is Matthew's getting everybody back to us. 11: But that does have bad holding. 3: Should have gone in August this year. 22: There are actually finance and security. 6: Sorry, I'll go quick. So I'll just use the exact summary slides in the main. So from an October year-to-day performance perspective, EPSA reported a profitable tax of 51.2 million under US GAAP. That's down 23.6 million on the same period last year. 16 million have been driven by reduced NDR as a result of discount rate erosion. And then we've got around 21 million being driven by the new transfer pricing operating model now that we've moved to the cost plus arrangement. So that new operating model is driving a lower level of profitability overall. What we've seen in recent years, but it does mean that we'll have less volatility in our results going forward and it will give us a level of protection as the discount rate continues to erode. I'd also just highlight that, as we expected under this new model, Easel is actually seeing higher profitability. So, when you look at it on an overall UK basis, we're in a pretty similar place to where we were before. 22: So, if money's moved from EASOL to Easel, actually it's not moved directly, it's just through the EAS, which was always felt to be more supportable because the issuers sort of seem to be taking on more risk for the business. 6: I'll maybe come on to a slide in a minute that just breaks down ESOL's profitability into a bit more detail as well, which I think is quite interesting for the board. But I'll just finish on these slides first. So, from a sort of full-year forecast perspective, we're anticipating a profitable tax of 61.7 million for 2025, and that would be down 9.4 million on the 2024 US GAP results. So, that's based on the 10 plus 2 forecast assumptions, assumes 11.7% volume growth and a two basis points year-over-year decline in discount rate. Capital monitoring, capital position still at 347 million as of the end of September, so very comfortably above the internal thresholds and the FCA minimum. Bottom of this page. 11: Why are we always so much higher than what it was? Why are we not utilising it? 6: There are considerations and discussions going on. So, it's basically driven by the Treasury team capital. They are actively looking at certain ways. Easel is even more up at over a billion capital. But it is something that's on the Treasury team's raise. Yep. That's like not being invested in the bank now. It's not sitting in the bank, it's that they're using the funds, it's just the equity position. 11: Oh, okay, yeah. 6: So, item number four, we received our annual update from Margone, who's part of the Spanish control ship team on our subsidiary, IPAY. So, IPAY is obviously a standalone entity, and we have no requirement to consolidate their results into ETSOL, but it's important that we continue to monitor that entity to demonstrate an appropriate level of oversight and to ensure that there's sort of no risk to our investment value. So, the biggest picture really to draw out from an IPAY perspective is they also saw a change in their operating model this year, which took effect on the 1st of January. So, they continue to be on the cost pass as they were before, but under the new model, they now get to retain their net financing income, which actually means they're seeing increased profitability this year. So, full year, they're expecting pre-tax profit of 37 million euros, which would be up 24% on the prior year, and also seeing sort of some underlying good performance in the business, 9% growth and volumes, and good overall performance. Their capital levels stand at 79 million euros, which is also very comfortably above the regulatory minimum, which is 22 million euros for them. And they're actually also considering the potential for dividends next year, which if it happens, would come up to ETSOL as the parent entity. So, all pretty positive there, and nothing that we're seeing from an IPAY perspective that's causing any concerns. Moving on to the next page, we've got the HMLC inquiries and assessments. So, we had a number of meetings with HMLC earlier in the year and had sort of numerous requests for information from them. Which we've given back, and then we've basically been waiting since the summer for HMRC to respond on that. We finally received something about a week ago, but rather than it being the sort of substantive response that we were hoping for with a full summary of their technical position, it was instead just another request for information. So we're kind of still in the same position to be honest, and the investigation just continues. 22: 190 million. 6: So the actual assessments that have been issued in respect of 2019 are much longer than that. They're about 90 million. But whatever they find for those years, we could expect them to apply to the LATCH. I was told 190 million. 22: That sounds too high. No, that's a bigger number, but I had 108 million. 108 maybe. Maybe I've got that maybe. 6: But we still as a worst case scenario, but we still think we could defend that. And we would, particularly on conversion-driven buying money, we would take that to court. But yeah, that's an absolute worst-case scenario, including interest and penalties. We're still hiding. 22: So we are on there with tax to discuss this because I wanted to understand it a bit more. Yeah, I mean, they're saying they would fight it to the death. Basically, they believe, we believe we're right. Who's it advising opinion? Deloitte is time. 6: Yeah, so we've, because we're coming up to year end, they've done a specific assessment on you know, where do we stand? Do we think has anything changed? Do we think any provisions are required? They've done that both with our tax team and then the Deloitte external advisors, and they've basically concluded nothing has changed based on all correspondence to date. We still think we've got very robust transfer pricing arrangements that are appropriate, and so they've still concluded that no revisions are required. And that's something that Deloitte will document in an email. Which is what they've done the previous two years as well, and that would be given to QC to support from an audit perspective. 15: I can see taxpayer money being used in the right place then. 6: I mean, it's interesting that they're still continuing to fight it. I think we're hoping they would have dropped it by now, but they've not come up with anything that's changed how we're feeling about it at this stage. Did we have a meeting last week? Yes, I was going to come on to that. So, yeah, last week then was what was effectively just our sort of standard business review meeting with HMRC. So, we used that meeting to tell them about our new operating model. It's the first conversation that we've had with them on that. You know, that was potentially a sensitive conversation given we're sort of spending all of this time defending our old model and then now we're going to be changing it going forwards. But actually, it ended up, by the sounds of these, being a very short conversation. HMLC raised no questions whatsoever in the meeting other than to just ask, you know, overall at the UK level, how much of an impact was it going to have on profitability? To which the answer was not very much, you know, across the two entities. So, you know, very, very little reaction in the meeting itself, but obviously, they could go away, digest it, and then come back with a load more questions. Can you say they encourage firms to do this sub action? Absolutely. So, yeah, HMLC actively encouraged firms to continually kind of reassess the business and whether the transfer price arrangements are appropriate. You know, we feel that enough has changed post-Brexit to justify why we're making this change to the operating model. And then we also actually started looking at this before they even raised the discovery assessments, so we can point to that. This hasn't been a reaction to those investigations. We also used that meeting to tell HMLC that we were intending to file an advance. Arrangement, which I mentioned at the last board meeting. So that would effectively get both HMRC's and the IRS's agreement to our transfer pricing arrangements on a formal basis and would stop them then being able to audit and investigate those periods. HMRC responded positively to that. They thought it was a good idea that we go for that APA, which was good news, but just to set expectations, that process tends to take about two years to work through. So we're not going to hear anything soon on that. And then lastly, HMLC have also now formally held open our 2023 tax return, which is completely standard practice given we've got the investigation into the early years and is fully expected. So I'm not planning to go through all of these detailed slides. If we could just jump to the next one. Yeah, this one's, I think, interesting just to spend a minute on. So this one just helps to kind of break out the results a bit more and to see the impact of that new operating model. So for the purposes of that, we effectively have to break the PL down into three parts. First is the true merchant acquiring business, for which the new model gives us fixed return on costs of 5%. As of October year to date, that merchant acquiring business was generating a profit of £8.1 million on a standalone basis. But if you look at the return it should have been receiving based on the 5% of costs, the profit level is only 3.6 million. So as a result of that, EAPSA had to post a cost plus adjustment of 4.5 million in Q3, which was payable to Trisco through the billing debit line to take us down to that targeted level of profit. The other two component parts that we see is the servicing business. So this is where EPSA was providing services to other AXP entities. That is already being Compensated on a cost-plus basis through monthly service fees, so that gets stripped out of the other cost-plus model to ensure that we're not double-counting. And then the third piece is net interest income, which also sits outside of the cost-plus model. But if you look at EPSCoS profitability overall, so we have 51 million PTI for October year to date, only 3.6 million of that is coming from the merchant acquiring business because of the kind of cost-plus restrictions. And then we've got 3.1 million of profit coming in from the servicing business. But by far, the biggest piece is the 46 million that we see coming in from interest income. So I thought it was just helpful to kind of re-highlight that because you know it's important that we have an appreciation of where the profit is coming from. Yeah. 22: Yeah, it's a big piece. Why are the salaries so different 24 to 25 when you've got less people? 6: I think we've generally seen the salaries and the sort of merit increases. We've seen for our sector, we've seen an increase in account. Only sort of small percentage points, but we've definitely seen it go on. 22: We need to clean up this. 6: We need to clean up these EPSCO cost sectors. I don't think this is necessarily a I'm not saying there aren't odd colleagues that might be in the right place. I don't think there's any significant problems. This is maybe more of a management versus neglect. But we can certainly look at reconciling between the two. 12: But it's the change year over year. 22: So yeah, that's what. 12: Why even at an EBSCO level? 14%. 22: I think what you're saying is there's a lot of you think about Kamal's team, but they are at GMS levels. Yeah, that's the same thing. Generating senior roles that we created, that's probably what's trying it. Okay, fine. 6: I can certainly take that away. I can ask you to smuggle revenue generators. 22: I'll call you out. 12: I've got the protection generator. Yeah, protection with your squashes. 22: That's true. Or not revenue generators. They see where the price of that work. Right. Okay, anything else to call it out to you in there? Okay, thanks for update. Danny, he's here. Good. Questions for Danny? 10: So this was interesting update. That's why we have time last. 22: Everyone looks forward. 9: Everyone's famous presentation. Hello. 22: I don't know about that. You're between us and the end, Danny. Oh, my really, just my mandate. Thank you for that. Thank you. Sorry? Yeah, we got it there. Make it good, Danny. 13: Make it account. I'll just go to something very briefly and I'll go into a deep dive into probably the main cause of concern that we've had over the last couple of months, or a few months, shall we say, the mandate fraud. But in terms of year-to-date results, insider risk is slightly down. That's our investigations where we have obviously concerns with colleagues within the workplace. And in terms of data loss violations, that's where colleagues send out data through an email channel with various different documentation, shall we say. And that is slight uptick compared to last year, just for his reference. The mandate fraud, I'll go on to the next part of the slide along with the vulnerable victim notification scheme, which I think will be of interest that I've mentioned on to the other legal entity we've had on the team. But I think it's really interesting as well how we work with merchants on that as well, in respect of vulnerable carpenters. You go to the next slide. Please. 22: So these numbers on this page are for the UK overall, overall. Yeah. I can't at the moment, I can't break it down. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. So there's obviously been a sharp increase in data loss. Yes. 13: I was surprised that I saw this. It still goes on. Still goes on. Particularly, we've seen one of the reasons probably there was a slight increase. It was to do with the internship program. where some of them colleagues within the internship programme sending material out after they've finished their programme internship shall we say and they will send it to themselves yes so they're trying to put a stop to that as well so these so can you just help us so so just going up this cross so staff related internal investigations yeah right data loss that's not when someone's got an alert and we it is stopped sending an email says many more cases than 27 this is a severe significant data loss that you involve yes we will get referrals coming in from information security no sensitivity loads start up i'm sorry sensitivity loads will start to it will start to impact i think going forward i would hope um you've got to register everything you want to send out exactly what's the threshold for data loss violation because to Dan's point I get them if I send stuff to a law firm for example and it flags up you can't send this presumably that's not no that's not included on that so there are certain thresholds that information security handle in terms of when they believe there is like an insider data loss data violation of bench so it varies but they hold the keys in terms of when they do the referrals once so it has to be significant probably a lot of PIRs preferred from don't it blocks them I thought they're blocks there is a pop-up that comes up I'm sure people have seen a pop-up but but they still 22: For it, but then there's a pop-up. I've had the pop-up before, then you get things where you get a message from someone in your team. You copy it to someone in your team, but you'll copy it saying we've blocked this file that you're going to see. Then you've got cases where actually it doesn't get to your setting, and then it simply gets through. Yes, and that gets out there and then gets referred to you if it's referred to us. 13: And we obviously deal with lines of business, MCO, EIRP, to deal with it. 22: So, how many of them have resulted in a CLR action? 13: Which, I mean, I imagine most of them a lot of them to be honest, it's a lot of consequence management in terms of training and education or anything else. The material we see there is an event, but it's not significant enough to actually go through the CLR process. But if we have a persistent offender, which we have in the past, we will send that to CLR. But you've got 35 that went up to arrest levels, that's obviously then the network. 7: That's an unrelated cascade. 22: That's unrelated, right? Okay, it's not 27 left. Have we ever arrested anybody for the data loss? No, unless there was something very simple. That's an unrelated top of the study. Question on the data loss one. I know we've got 27 above-threshold data losses, but I think we've only had one notifiable event to the Information Commissioner's office. So there's probably a conversation for my team to have with you about making sure we're aligned on those two points. 13: What we do with that, Joe as well. Depending on the significance of them events, we will send it to EIR people who then do the handling point of view in terms of notification. Thank you. Take going, Danny. Next page, please. I won't go into too much detail on this, but some good recoveries we've had over the last year, significant recoveries compared to 2024. This is recoveries in the world. Recoveries in terms of stopping fraud. Colleague's fraud. Colleague fraud. No, this is just fraud in general, to be honest. So if we have a fraud report about a car member, we have the opportunity to speak to the merchant to stop them goods. We can do that. That's just an example there. So we have a daily tag fraud report that comes to myself and my colleagues. We will work on that to look for any particular series of frauds. But more importantly, as well, to see if we can stop the fraud as well, because we safekey, we have the liability. We can stop that. We do. So there's some significant recoveries we've had over the last year. Right, mandate fraud. 22: Mandate for a topic. I thought you could do a picture of prison cell on this. That's not how. 13: No, I can give you an update on that as well, but I've just spoke to the officer this morning. Okay, right. So, as everybody's aware, we've had significant events with these particular threat actors targeting our online portal, trying to get the bank settlement changed on some of our high-end hotel groups, particularly around the Mayfair area. This is the bank fraud, right? Everyone gets aware of that. 12: Where they were setting up changing accounts for the MAX. 13: So we've developed a script. So basically, we've developed a script where we can identify particular device IDs that are being used on the online portal to say that that is part of this particular threat actor or threat actors within the organised criminal network that obviously are targeting us. That's been really quite successful. We've been able to actually stop quite a lot of the activity. However, they're not silly. They've changed their tactics and now they're targeting certain email domains where they're doing an impersonation on an email domain of a particular hotel group to try and get onto the DMX platform to change the user IDs, generate user IDs and also attempt to change the bank settlement account details. At no stage have they been successful to do that at this time, which is great. Are good. We're working very closely with Malenka's team, Paul Wilson's team, GMS Risk, servicing teams to make sure we've got all these lines of defences in place to stop this activity. And as I say, at the moment, that's been very successful. In terms of when the Forces are setting up bogus email domains where they try and impersonate the hotel group, we've captured them for email diverts on. So they're not going to the servicing teams anymore. They've been diverted to myself and my team to stop that particular manual review as well, Sharia. So we know what ones are high risk. We're obviously working with the client managers as well. They are aware of this particular change in tactic. And also, Dan, as you're aware, we've stopped any bank settlement changes as of the 19th of December through the US. Yes, we're just not going to do it over Christmas. 22: We know about it. That's right. We're just not doing it. This is where there's not many people around, servicing are scaling through. It's like there's too much of a risk. No big organisation changed the game at that time anyway. So it's not, we just agree that we're just not going to do it. Two weeks, isn't it? Two weeks, yeah. From the 19th of December. If I was them, that's when I'd hit us. They're not stupid. They work out when people are around. 4: So the DMX ultimately is going to be the solution to this. 12: Yeah, and two-factor authentication. And I think Paul Wilson is due to give us an update, I know, on that in terms of the timing of when that's going to happen. I think. 13: Do you know what it is? As far as I'm aware, I believe it's going to be Q1, Q2. That's what I've learned through the solution and the team. It doesn't solve that. 22: He solved, it shuts down one problem. That means it was coming another door. And they're actually coming in the voice channel, haven't they? They're very convincing. I mean, this is some of the most convincing people he's heard. 12: We also have some controls, like, so what we decided is because lodging was the industry that they first targeted. And specifically within a certain number of postcodes within London as well, that any bank change that was have to require a client manager approval. 22: It can't be approved just bank changes requiring a client. 12: But this Christmas one is for like any merchant over a million, I think. 22: It's a broader topic. We just can't run with the risk. I mean, last Christmas, what they do is for two million. We came in like the first week back. So I think we've lost two and a half million in the first week. It's like crazy. So that's why we're going to be more cautious this Christmas. Right. Anything else? Any other what about the loss? One quick one there. On the email diverts, very much aligned with it. I've been burned repeatedly in the national press on email diverts. So could you pick up with my team just to make sure we've spotted every I and crossed every T on that subject? Sure, true. What even is an email drop there? What is it? So they think they're emailing servicing, but they're actually emailing daddy. Yeah, so I know far too much about the subject. What happens is someone sends in an email, there's a thing called a transport rule within the, just inside our firewall. So you think it's going here and it in fact gets transferred somewhere because it makes it different. But the person who sent it doesn't know. And what we found was there were, well, without saying too much private information in my previous organisation, a number of them were put in place. I think it accidentally captured a whole range of emails that it wasn't intended to capture. And that led to some very significant challenges. So you're thinking from a privacy perspective, he sees the information, but it's locked down to security. So just you want to explore and check that. I want to make sure it's there and there are some white lists, there is a single white list. Suggest putting it in, which is if we have an external whistleblowing line, email line, that there is a whitelist in there. I speak from very significant personal experience on the subject, so let's have a like section to connect this. Yeah, right, last bullet on this day. 13: So, so the good news is that law enforcement are doing some executive action, they have got the warrant in place, okay. Maybe not just for the minutes, can I, as well? But what they're trying to do at the moment, they're doing some covert tactics to identify when the phones are pinging in a particular area in West Midlands. So then they can go through without a warrant for that address. At the moment, phones that are associated with the threat actors are actually in London, so there's no point in going to the address until they start pinging. So, hopefully, in the next week or so, we'll have some success. 22: It'll be our Thanksgiving, it'll be our turn. I would say that that is their home address. Go into not for the minutes. I know CC tells us when we say not for the minutes, so it'll be our turn to give them a Christmas present. Oh, I would hope so. As I said, two one to our message. 9: Not for the minutes from a security perspective. 13: But what I would say is, I know it's been a long and projective type investigation, but we have to get the attributions right to these threat actors. We've got to do this right, haven't we? You've got to do this right because not for the minute. They are known to police and known to another regulator, shall we say, who does leave it at that, leave it as that. Okay, right. So, hopefully, good news on that. 22: But it shows how you've got to be on it. You know, we've probably talked about this quite a lot. Shut down. This Christmas, I feel confident that something else will pop up next year. 15: That's because individuals were absent, and therefore steps were passed. I think that's the only thing that's happening. 11: Individuals were absent. 22: They were ahead of us. They were ahead of us. 13: I'll just cover this off very quickly, but we've part of the scheme now with UK Finance. It's proof of concept with law enforcement where if law enforcement have a victim of fraud who is vulnerable and they know that they have a facility with us or any other financial institution, they will reach out to them to protect that particular victim. We had a case recently where an elderly person, vulnerable card member as well, was part of a courier scam and lost £400,000, not with Amix, but overall during the course of that particular scam, they took his American Express card as well and we had an exposure of about £10,000. But with these protocols in place, we can actually then start doing blocks as well on our accounts. So even though the victim doesn't accept they are a victim, we can actually put some blocks in place to protect the customer and the account. And that would just follow through if they're a small business and they're a merchant and the police come and say there's a small business, there's vulnerable you do the same. Yeah, we do the same. But in relation to this, when we've seen we've got a victim and we know that they're spending a particular merchant, because these forces always say to send them to very high-end merchants, we will speak to our counterparts at the merchants. Where it's Harrod the Silverges, we will say to him, look, this is a scam, please obviously be aware and we're trying to protect the government we're going forward. We have a duty of account. 22: Question for you, Daniel. Do you think Phil you've got the right relationship to the merchants? I mean it's like, obviously there's a client management team but I think you've built a lot of things. Yeah, I've obviously said TFL bit last week. 13: So is there anything else that you feel really got with relationships? A lot of the time some of you're a community of people. It's getting harder in terms of trying to get support from some of the merchants, particularly passive data CCTV because they say they can only give that to police. But we use our terms and conditions to say we need to Supporting material for that particular fraud. So I think we're covered from that aspect. But a lot of the time we have great relationships with the high-end merchants. Good. Let's talk payfax quickly then. Payfax, I won't go into too much detail of this, but I know me and Keith have had a conversation over the last week or so. These are just some of the case studies we see with PayFax. The first case study there, you can see that there was a signer that had a taxi show for car service and business. 14 merchants or mids were set up over Porphyry over four PayFax. There's a variation in the name of the business. So that tells me that obviously the PayFax are not doing, potentially they're doing their dual dividends on KYC, potentially, or not sharing the information as well that I've mentioned previously as well. So as you can see here, these particularly both of them are linked to the prohibited industry. The majority of the transactions taking place early morning, all male customers. And these are just the fraud losses. That cellar one over here, they were set up with a payfax, but they were actually basically like a platform. So both of these have all been shut down, but I just wanted to highlight what we're seeing in terms of the hibit industry. 22: So in terms of payfax, because like 1.6 million of our locations that are active in the UK are now payfax, 200,000 are direct, right? 13: Do you feel you've got the right links with Dojo, World Pay, Slow Payments, Summer? You have those. Yeah, we're working with Keith and the partner managers. Because I presume Dojo has a couple of, yeah. To be honest, Dojo are probably one of the best. We have a one-to-one link to it. But it's just the bigger players, to be honest, as well. Lots of stripes, summer. But through Keith's work and that, we've got that, we've got a process. 22: If you don't feel like you've got the relationships you need, then you need to come and tell us because we'll get that's what we've agreed. That's what we're crazy, haven't we? 15: He's got visibility of all of our partners like the manager. That's the first quarter call. If the partner isn't doing anything other than fully cooperative. 22: This goes up on the agenda for like when obviously global payments have got it now. I'd want it on my agenda with Nick Corrigan. This is an equal business topic to the commercials, right? Yeah. Okay, all right, fine. Good. Okay, and that's it. Any questions, other questions? 8: What's the significance of early in the morning? Like, you've got that on both? 13: That's the transaction. We can always identify a particular activity. They normally go put up from other establishments, putting ourselves later on mail. Yeah. So, although there have been cases, like the typology of these type of transactions. But they're not. 12: It's us that identified these, not the PFABs coming to us. Like, we know that they identify them. 22: Sometimes that's the charge on A to B. 12: Just charge taxes. Yeah, because they don't want to pay for it. 13: Is that what we mean? If you can see right from there, obviously you've got the taxi one, but you wouldn't really expect a taxi to be charged with 5,000. 22: Cheers, Danny. Good job. I'll do your posting. Thank you. Looking forward to it. Thank you. Take it. Send me what you're doing. Send me a word. Let's hope that nothing on the bank mandate in January. Well, that's right. 16: Final options. 22: We're there. 16: Health and safety update, which was noting. I hope anybody's got any questions. Just email us and we can check with the team. There was one action for the health and safety team, and that's been action and responded to on page 138, which was what are the four responsibilities for Coden Markets. But if you've got any questions, just let me know. 22: Okay. 16: I think that's everything. 22: That brings us to a conclusion. Thanks for your attention. I know it's been a long agenda. Our next meeting is on the 24th of February. We're going to do the meetings on Tuesday next year. The reason we do the meetings on Tuesdays is because then lots of people have said they want to go and travel, go and do other meetings, and if it's in a Wednesday, I think.","segments":[{"id":0,"seek":0,"start":0.24,"end":1.28,"text":"Speaker 22: Okay,

less but it's really driven by less inbounds revenues have come in 7.1% up year over year 3% down versus plan that's two reasons the first reasons revenues are down is because we've seen much more growth in PayFax which is a lower rate so we've seen a margin impact we've also seen much more growth in lower discount rate nurturing so Pizza Express USL versus Fine Dining as an example the third reason is SECM share so there has been a lot more spend with PayFax and where there's more spend with POFAX GMS keeps less in some cases takes none gets no discount revenue all goes to the issuer and that mix of how much was going to take place with Payfax is well out of sync in terms of the plan Julia compared to what's actually happened it's actually about half of our revenue miss is SECM and it was SECA is a result of SECM versus plan you can think of it like that but that's all stated obviously within the blue box and then PTI has come in 2.0 nearly 360 million 2.6 down versus plan 11.6 up

are using their cards for lots more transactions than people we acquired 20 years ago and they are you know we get nearly eighty percent of their credit card spent and they're spending in lots more of our merchants and we're growing pti and revenue here yeah we're growing revenue so like the net the dis the average discount rate has been impacted and just for context for everybody typically two to three bips is average year on year erosion you see a lot of it is actually driven by gcg deals which are very heavy on impact at least for half of it is gcg so the way you think about it is a third is

what we would do at the interim seems like you're all kind of presented with this situation that you're managing as best you can but it's not ideal so I think that that aspect of it that's the leg up was the leg up who was actually Karen and Hannah couldn't action that okay so do you want to take an action for me Keith and Suzanne to do the same action to do similar I mean the I think issue yeah I think from a legal entity point of view it's helpful to if something's been kind of imposed on us without discussion even if easel is already doing it we're doing it from this side from this board as well okay and I'll speak to because I would expect IPA to want to do the same okay they've had their disputes go but they haven't done that okay all
